    <p>Hiroyuki is a pioneer in the world of anonymous communities, and can be thought of as the great-grandfather of 4chan. His creation of 2channel in 1999 sparked an era of anonymous-centric web culture in Japan that led to the creation of Futaba Channel, the site that inspired 4chan.

    <p>I founded 4chan eleven and a half years ago at the age of 15, and after more than a decade of service, I've decided it's time for me to move on.</p>

    <p>4chan has faced numerous challenges over the years, including how to continuously <a href="/news?all#114" target="_blank" title="4chan - News - FULL HOUSE">satisfy a community of millions</a>, and ensure the site has the human, technical, and <a href="/news?all#109" target="_blank" title="4chan - News - IF ONLY IT GREW ON TREES">financial resources</a> to continue operating. But the biggest hurdle it's had to overcome is myself. As 4chan's sole administrator, decision maker, and keeper of most of its institutional knowledge, I've come to represent an uncomfortably large <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure" target="_blank" title="Single point of failure - Wikipedia">single point of failure</a>.</p>

    <p>I've spent the past two years working behind the scenes to address these challenges, and to provide 4chan with the foundation it needs to survive me by bolstering its finances, strengthening its infrastructure, and expanding and empowering its team of volunteers. And for the most part, I've succeeded. The site isn't in danger of going under financially any time soon, and it's as fast and stable as ever thanks to continued development and recent server upgrades. Team 4chan is also at its largest, and while I've still been calling the shots, I've delegated many of my responsibilities to a handful of trusted volunteers, most of whom have served the site for years.</p>

    <p>That foundation will now be put to the ultimate test, as today I'm retiring as 4chan's administrator. From a user's perspective, nothing should change. A few senior volunteers&mdash;including 4chan's lead developer, managing moderator, and server administrator&mdash;have stepped up to ensure a smooth transition over the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>I'll need time away to decompress and reflect, but I look forward to one day returning to 4chan as its Admin Emeritus or just another Anonymous, and also writing more about my experience running 4chan on my <a href="http://chrishateswriting.com" target="_blank" title="Chris Hates Writing">personal blog</a>. The journey has been marked by highs and lows, surprises and disappointments, but ultimately immense satisfaction. I'm humbled to have had the privilege of both founding and presiding over what is easily one of the greatest communities to ever grace the Web. It was truly an honor to serve as 4chan's founding administrator, and I look forward to seeing what the next decade holds for the site.</p>

    <p>On to the next chapter,

    <h3><span class="newssub">FULL HOUSE by moot - 9/18/13 @ 9:00PM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#114" id="114" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>Moderation has always been a hot-button issue on 4chan. <em>"What's considered 'on-topic'?", "How strictly should the rules be enforced?", et cetera</em> have all been debated for years, but while the questions have remained the same, the 4chan of today is not the 4chan of yesterday.</p>

    <p>Last month, 4chan was accessed by 22.5 million unique visitors. For comparison, during that same period five years ago, the site was accessed by 3.2 million unique visitors. Rules 1 and 2 be damned, 4chan has grown dramatically over the years.</p>

    <p>Despite a seven-fold increase in visitors, what hasn't changed much is the site itself. Aside from the front page redesign some six and a half years ago (a scandal in its day) and the introduction of the catalog and inline extension, from a user's perspective, the form and function of 4chan has largely remained the same. This has been deliberate. While we've made numerous behind-the-scenes improvements to support the site's growth, we've always sought preserve the core 4chan user experience, which is why almost every new user-facing feature has been made optional.</p>

    <p>Another thing that hasn't changed much is the number of boards we host. Today we host about 60 boards, whereas in 2008 we hosted just over 40. Why the disparity? I could (and probably will) write an entire news post about this, but for the most part, we've tried to serve a diverse set of interests with as few boards as possible. This is done in the interest of establishing a critical mass to ensure round-the-clock activity, and to avoid unnecessarily fragmenting the community.</p>

    <p>So here we are, trying to cram significantly more people into a marginally expanded site, with what is essentially the same software and roughly the same number of volunteers. It's not surprising that this overcrowding has led to quarrels amongst users and disagreements with the staff. We're simply struggling to accommodate more users than ever, who want to discuss more topics, coupled with strong opinions regarding what does and doesn't belong.</p>

    <p>The purpose of 4chan's <a href="/rules" target="_blank">Rules page</a> is to answer that question&mdash;what does and doesn't belong. If you look through the rules (as I'm sure you all have), I think you'll find them to be well-intentioned and straightforward. The majority seek to clarify what constitutes "on-topic" posting, and their purpose is not to stifle discussion, but to facilitate it. They're also written to be clearly understood by both the users and moderators, to ensure both compliance and consistency in their enforcement.</p>

    <p>Why is "on-topic" discussion so important anyway? It's important to remember that on 4chan every time a new thread is created, <em>one thread is removed</em>. Put another way, for every 10 "culture" threads that are posted, 10 potentially board-appropriate threads are automatically pruned.</p>

    <p>There's that word&mdash;<em>culture</em>. "Board culture" is a relatively new term to 4chan, and a particularly divisive one. On one hand, every board undoubtedly has its own unique culture&mdash;it's why we're proud to call ourselves /v/irgins and /k/ommandos. On the other hand, "culture" is often used to justify posts that have little to do with the topic of a board. Under the guise of "board culture," countless off-topic threads are created every day, pushing on-topic discussion off the board. What is considered acceptable board culture is often a grey area, since the term is usually suited to an individual's personal taste, or that of a vocal minority. As one Anon so aptly put it, <em>"One man's 'culture' is another man's 'shitpost.'"</em></p>

    <p>Which brings us to that <em>other</em> word&mdash;<em>shitpost</em>. The term "shitpost" has consumed the zeitgeist of 4chan in recent months, and it's a challenge to spend more than a few minutes browsing without stumbling into threads where accusations of shitposting fly left and right. Shitposting, like board culture, is hard to pin down, but I'd define it as simply "knowingly contributing low quality, off-topic, or ill intentioned posts."</p>

    <p>4chan's gift of anonymity offers us something not often found on today's Web&mdash;the opportunity to speak our mind and share ideas and be judged for the content of what we write rather than who we are. For a long time, this resulted in an environment unlike any other, one that fostered and rewarded creativity and experimentation. However these days, many posters use this precious gift as a license to say and do whatever they'd like, often to the detriment of the board. Using 4chan should be enjoyable&mdash;but your enjoyment of the site shouldn't come at the expense of your fellow 4channers.</p>

    <p>Our small team of volunteers is tasked with an impossible feat: maintaining order and sifting through a never-ending supply of reports and posts, all whilst doing their best to please millions of people. But we try our best, and to that end we've made a number of changes and improvements these past few months. Below is a recap of some of these changes, as well as changes we'll be making going forward. Let's start with some of the previous changes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>We've added multiple features to improve content discovery.</strong> People tend to perceive a board's "quality" based on how quickly they're able to find content relevant to their interests, while avoiding content that isn't. We introduced the catalog (and recently added [Search] to the board indexes) to help users quickly survey a board and navigate to threads that interest them. We also added infinite scroll to board indexes (click [All] in the page switcher) to encourage users browse past the first few pages, and have continued to improve our inline extension and its features (notably the thread watcher and filters). If you haven't already checked out the inline extension, you can do so by clicking [Settings] in the upper or lower-right corner of your screen.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Our moderation tools were overhauled.</strong> The report queue and appeals interface were rewritten from scratch, resulting in more efficient processing of reports and appeals. The perception that moderation has increased in the past few months is due to moderators and janitors having access to these superior tools, and not any policy changes. Appeals are now processed within hours as opposed to days or weeks, and many of the ban templates have been reduced to 1-3 day board-specific bans. In addition, our moderator and janitor activity log viewer was rewritten to increase oversight. We also audited and removed a number of old spam filters, IP range bans, and country blocks.</p></li>
        </ul>

    <p>Going forward, the following will change:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>sage is now invisible.</strong> sage is <em>not</em> a downvote, and this misconception has persisted for far too long. sage replies will continue to function as they have in the past, but will no longer be displayed in the e-mail field.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>I'll be doing livestreamed audio PMQ/Q&amp;A sessions from now on, as opposed to written ones.</strong> The audio format enables me to give longer answers to meatier questions, which had been a criticism of the written format. You can listen to the first one <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8eKUzPnW5s&amp;t=1m44s" target="_blank">here</a>. And be sure to subscribe to our <a href="//www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzaqOjCxPAwyQ0X1gxZ65w" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a> so you can catch future PMQs and our <a href="/news?all#113" target="_blank">10th Anniversary Panel</a> livestream on September 28th.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>/q/ will be retired and replaced.</strong> The imageboard will be replaced with a suggestion box, where you'll be able to contribute feedback, report moderation concerns, and file bug reports. Answers will be searchable and linkable from the boards. As always, questions/comments/concerns can be sent to me directly at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span>.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Post timers are now applied separately to intra- and inter-thread replies.</strong> For worksafe boards, intra-thread post timers have been increased to encourage more thoughtful, less chatroom-y replies, whereas inter-thread timers are presently unchanged. On the not-worksafe boards, most of the timers remain the same. The sage timer has been lowered to match that of a normal reply.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Last but not least, we're making bans more transparent.</strong> The <a href="/bans" target="_blank">public ban log</a> displays a sample of recent bans, which we hope will give users insight into what content is being removed, and why.</p></li>
        </ul>

    <p>With 4chan's 10th anniversary just two weeks away, I'm reminded of a <a href="/news?all#95" target="_blank">similar news post I wrote in 2008</a>. It touches on many of the same issues I've discussed here, and ends with the following note:</p>

    <p><em style="color: dimgrey;">"Enough about all that though&mdash;back to the big picture. What I want users to take from this gigantic pile of words is that I'm still here and excited as ever to be working on 4chan. We have a lot in store for the site in the coming months. As I've said in the past, stagnation is not acceptable, and 4chan will continue to make strides forward in development. For a site that's essentially just "pictures and text", 4chan has become so much more, and I'm proud of what we as a community have accomplished in what will soon be five years. Thank you for continuing to be a part of it."</em></p>

    <p>I feel the same way today as I did five years ago&mdash;excited for the future, and proud of how far we've come. Thanks as always for continuing to be a part of something great.</p>

    Thanks to our old friend, <a href="http://manga.clone-army.org/" target="_blank">Dan Kim</a>.</span>

    <p>My, how time flies. It feels like just yesterday that I was sitting at a microphone, surrounded by a thousand of my meme-spouting compatriots.</p>

    <p>Despite hosting three extremely succesful panels at Otakon 2005, 2006, and <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/otakon07-roomseated.jpg" target="_blank">2007</a>, I never expected I'd host another. For one thing, we <a href="/news?all#100" target="_blank">weren't invited back</a> in 2008&mdash;not to mention I haven't attended a con in almost five years.</p>

    <p>But a recent dinner with some of 4chan's original moderators had us reminiscing about how much fun it was to throw those old panels, and we figured hell&mdash;what better a way to celebrate 4chan's 10th birthday than with 1,900 of our closest friends? Thus, we're pleased to announce:</p>

    <p><span class="center"><strong style="font-size: 15pt; text-decoration: underline;">4chan: The Official 10th Anniversary Panel</strong><br /><br />
    <strong style="font-size: 11pt; padding-top: 15px;"><a href="http://www.awa-con.com/?ref=4chan" target="_blank">Anime Weekend Atlanta 2013</a>, September 28th, 10:00PM ET &ndash; Main Events</strong></span></p>

    <p>The panel will be hosted by myself and <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/greenshirtguy_rip.jpg" target="_blank">shut</a>, and feature a number of familiar faces. If you never had the [mis]fortune of attending one of our Otakon panels, you can find them on <a href="//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWEf1LModzsDofRE19nMMnGCCT9OrMOC7" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. AWA has generously given us use of Main Events on Saturday night at 10:00PM, and we plan to put it to good use&mdash;quarantining the 4channers in attendance. In all honesty, we have only the vaguest sense of what we'll be doing, but I hope you'll join us for what's likely to be our last rodeo. If previous years are any indication, it should be blast. And at the very least, we can shoot for the Guinness World Record of "most fedoras in one room."</p>

    <p>So for those of you who can join us, I hope you will. And for those who can't, I hope you'll join us via stream (more info to follow).</p>

    <p>See you there!</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Since this announcement comes on somewhat short notice, we'd appreciate your help spreading the word. Have a friend attending AWA or in the Atlanta area? Tell them to come! If you plan to attend the con and haven't already registered, be sure to do so as soon as possible since pre-registration ends tonight. You can <a href="https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1114022" target="_blank">register here</a> using coupon code "topkek" for a $2 discount. Also ZUN will be there. How can you <em>not</em> come?</p>

    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: I stumbled into these <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chan_con_buttons.jpg" target="_blank"> old con buttons</a> and downtime pages, triggering quite a trip down memory lane. The original artwork the 4chan community produced back in the day is truly incredible. If you haven't already checked out the <a href="/flash" target="_blank">4chan Flash Archive</a>, I highly suggest you do&mdash;4chan City, Sage Man, and LongCat's Song are personal favorites.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">UPDATES by moot - 10/25/12 @ 3:30AM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#112" id="112" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>Last month we began accepting janitor applications for the first time in more than a year. We were overwhelmed by the response and received almost 10,000 applications in just 24 hours.</p>

    <p>Now that we've had time to sort through them, we'll be adding janitors in batches over the coming weeks. High traffic boards and boards that need extra moderator attention are our priority, and we hope to have the rest covered shortly after.</p>

    <p>In addition to new janitors, we've made two noteworthy changes to our moderation system. The first change is the introduction of a temporary posting block that is applied when a janitor submits a ban request. When a ban request is submitted by a janitor, the user will be blocked from posting for 15 minutes while a moderator reviews the request. If the request is approved, then a regular ban is added (as is the case now), and if the request is denied, the block is removed immediately. This change is being introduced to address the biggest challenge janitors have faced over the years, which is an inability to stop ban evaders, spammers, et cetera from posting while they wait for a moderator to become active and approve their request.</p>

    <p>The second change is that we've made bans re-appealable. Historically, once a ban appeal was submitted and denied, there was no way to re-appeal it. You may now appeal your ban up to 5 times, with a short waiting period between each appeal. This should give users with long and permanent bans whose appeals had previously been denied an opportunity to have their ban lifted.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, here are a few more changes from the past month and a half:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><p>4chan's inline extension gained a number of new features, including image hover previews, inline quoting, keyboard shortcuts, and more. Check it out by clicking [Settings] in the upper right-hand corner of any imageboard page. Have a feature request or bug report? Let us know <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS/issues" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p>The 4chan API now supports indexes as endpoints. You can find updated documentation <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API" target="_blank">here</a>. Fun fact: We're currently processing 50 million API requests <em>per day</em>.</p></li>

    <li><p>A few of our servers have been upgraded, adding faster disks and more memory. The site should be functioning as fast as ever.</p></li>

    <li><p>The default post limits on the NSFW boards were increased to match the worksafe boards, at 300 bumps and 150 image replies.</p></li>

    <li><p>With the release of iOS 6, you can now start threads and upload images from mobile Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.</p></li>

    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>That's all for now! Expect another update concerning janitors once we've added the first few batches.</p>

    <p>As always, I can be reached by e-mail at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span> and on Twitter at @<a href="//twitter.com/moot" target="_blank">moot</a> and @<a href="//twitter.com/4chan" target="_blank">4chan</a>.</p>

    "permalink"> <a href="?all#110" id="110" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>Last week we introduced <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass" target="_blank">4chan Pass</a> as a way of supporting the site in exchange for a convenient feature. Since then, I've received a handful of questions and feedback that I'd like to address.</p>

    <hr />

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; text-decoration: underline;">4chan Pass Q&amp;A</p>

    <ul>

    <li><p><strong>Why not accept traditional donations?</strong><br />
    I covered this in my <a href="/news?all#109" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, but I'll take another stab at it.</p>
    <p>I am not a fan of ongoing donations. I don't believe it's a model that can sustain large websites (with notable exceptions such as Wikipedia, which also relies on millions in donated hardware and bandwidth, and contributions that are tax-deductible), and frankly, I just don't like them. It's always been my desire to provide 4chan for free to as many people as possible, for as long as possible&mdash;something that gets harder and harder as the years go by and the site's traffic increases&mdash;and view the introduction of 4chan Passes as a means to maintain that goal. I'm proud that we haven't accepted a penny in donations for more than seven years, and view a paid product or service such as a 4chan Pass as an acceptable alternative that provides users with a way of giving back while receiving something of value in return.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>I don't feel safe giving 4chan my credit card information.</strong><br />
    All transactions are processed securely by our payment provider&mdash;your card information <em>never</em> passes through nor is it stored on our servers. Your information is sent directly from your browser to their servers for processing. You can learn more about their security <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Will you accept PayPal or alternative payment methods in the future?</strong><br />
    At this time, it's unlikely we'll offer PayPal, Google Checkout, Bitcoin, or other payment methods. If you'd like to purchase a Pass and it's not possible for you to use a debit or credit card, try purchasing a gift card or check if your bank/payment method of choice allows you to generate a "virtual" credit card number.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Will Passes be offered for terms shorter than one year?</strong><br />
    4chan Passes will only be offered in one year increments for a cost of $20 USD, which works out to $1.67 per month, or less than the average 20oz bottle of soda.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Why can a Pass only be used from one location at a time?</strong><br />
    Passes may only be used by one IP address at a time due concerns over abuse. You may use a Pass with multiple devices so long as they access 4chan from the same IP address. You can change the IP associated with your Pass once every 30 minutes (lowered from 6 hours!), and this will happen automatically when posting from a device that has already been authorized and cookied. Unless your IP changes more than once every 30 minutes, you shouldn't notice this at all.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>I've been banned in the past/am banned often&mdash;will my Pass be revoked?</strong><br />
    In most cases, no. Passes must be revoked manually, and will only be revoked under <a href="/pass#banned">limited circumstances</a>. Regular bans and auto-bans will not revoke your Pass, however you may not use your Pass while banned.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>What about the potential for spam and abuse?</strong><br />
    Passes that are used to spam or post illegal content will be revoked, and the payment will not be refunded. In addition, Pass users are still subject to the standard post timers and spam filters.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>I can't post because my ISP, IP range, or country is blocked. Can I use a Pass?</strong><br />
    Yes. Using a 4chan Pass will allow you to bypass blanket ISP and country blocks, but not individual IP bans.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Can I purchase a Pass as a gift for someone else?</strong><br />
    Yes. Shortly after introducing 4chan Passes, we added the ability to purchase them as a gift. Simply click "Purchase this Pass as a gift for someone else" on the payment form, enter the gift recipient's e-mail address, and we'll mail them the Pass details and a confirmation to you.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Is it possible to donate to 4chan without purchasing a Pass?</strong><br />
    No. Again, Passes were introduced as an alternative to accepting donations. If you'd like to support the site, consider purchasing a Pass.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Is it possible to pay more than $20 for a Pass?</strong><br />
    Nope! But if you're interested in contributing more, feel free to purchase Passes as gifts for friends or strangers, or purchase more than one for yourself.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Why is CAPTCHA still necessary?</strong><br />
    4chan requires CAPTCHA because spam continues to be an enormous problem for us. Every day, thousands upon thousands of spam posts are automatically filtered before reaching the image boards, and still hundreds slip through. CAPTCHA is extremely effective at blocking automated spam, and spam that slips through is often submitted manually by spammers, or by people paid to solve CAPTCHAs.</p>
    <p>In addition to commercial spam, we've also had problems with user flooding, advertising, viruses, worms, and more. Prior to the implementation of CAPTCHA, <em>entire boards</em> were wiped due to spam on a regular basis&mdash;all 10-15 pages. CAPTCHA may be inconvenient, but without it, there wouldn't be a 4chan.</p></li>

    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>If you were on the fence about purchasing a <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">Pass</a>, I hope these answers helped some. If you have a question that wasn't answered here, please feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:4chanpass@4chan.org?subject=4chan%20Pass%20-%20Question">4chanpass@4chan.org</a>. Thanks as always for your support.</p>

    <p>Expect a news post next week with an update on janitor applications, and a handful of other moderation and site improvements.</p>

    <p><strong>PS</strong>: Only three days to go until 4chan's 9th birthday!</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">IF ONLY IT GREW ON TREES by moot - 09/18/12 @ 10:00AM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#109" id="109" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>After publishing my news update <a href="/news?all#106">commemorating 4chan's billionth post</a>, I received an outpouring of support from people unaware I had borne the financial burden of keeping the site afloat over the years. Many asked how they could donate, and were disappointed to learn 4chan does not accept donations. With the re-introduction of banner ads to our not-worksafe boards this weekend (which were removed almost a year ago), I believe now is as good a time as any to address these questions.</p>

    <p>Historically, 4chan has sustained itself in two ways&mdash;advertising and donations.</p>

    <p>Since its earliest days, 4chan has run banner ads to help recoup its formidable hosting costs. Many of you have seen J-List's ads on our worksafe boards, which have been running for the better part of the past nine years. Despite our long-standing relationship with J-List, their ads alone cannot support the cost of the site.</p>

    <p>I have always done my best to hold 4chan's advertising to a high standard. Most advertisers who approach us wish to run ads that are irrelevant, pornographic, or have sound, movement, Flash, pop-ups, et cetera. I personally don't block ads and thus browse the site with every ad I'd ask you to. The upside is that with the exception of the adult ads we ran during the economic crisis of 2008, 4chan's advertising has always been unobtrusive, tasteful, and relevant. The downside is that for the past year the site has failed to break even, and I've been covering the loss out of my own pocket.</p>

    <p>Many of you have suggested we turn to donations, as we did several years ago. In 2005 we ran a donation drive to raise money to purchase servers, colocate them, and host the site for one year. Ultimately, we fell short of the $20,000 fundraising target, but I still fulfilled my promise&mdash;I purchased three servers, colocated them, and have now hosted the site for more than <strong>7 years</strong> without asking for or accepting a <em>single penny</em> from the community.</p>

    <p>Since then, I've made it clear that I do not intend accept donations again. Why? I don't believe in large websites supporting themselves through ongoing donations (a la Wikipedia), both ideologically and practically. I <em>hate</em> the thought of asking users to donate money and receive nothing of value other than "the site doesn't die." Our previous donation drive was more comparable to a modern day crowd-funding project. I asked the community to contribute $20,000 to accomplish three discrete goals, stated a timeframe, and made good on my promise. An explicit contract existed between myself and the contributors, and there was no question about what was being offered in exchange for contributing towards the goal. Ongoing donations are different because there is no stated, discrete goal. You've supported the site by contributing, but now what? What does that get you&mdash;what do you receive in exchange?</p>

    <p>Recently it was suggested on /q/ that we allow users to pay to bypass entering a verification when posting, as an alternative to accepting donations. Many people wrote me on /q/ and via e-mail in support of the idea, and after careful consideration, I've decided to implement it. Paying for a product or service is fundamentally different from a donation, while still accomplishing the same goal, and I view this as an acceptable compromise between the two models described above.</p>

    <p>Starting today we'll be offering <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">4chan Passes</a> as way of supporting the site. You'll find more details at the linked page, but essentially a Pass will allow you to bypass entering a CAPTCHA when posting on the image boards. You'll still be subject to the post timers and nobody else will know you're using a Pass&mdash;your posts will appear exactly the same. But for the many who wished to donate but were unable, I'm pleased to offer this as an alternative whereby you're able to support the site and receive a convenient feature in return.</p>

    <p>In two weeks 4chan will turn 9 years old&mdash;something that is almost unfathomable to me. It has always been my goal to provide the community with the best site possible, for as long as I'm able to. We've had our ups and downs, but between the recent HTML5 refactor, mobile site, overhaul of our moderation system, public API, native extension, and new janitors, I'm as excited as ever to explore what the future holds in store.</p>

    <p>If you believe in this mission, I hope you'll consider supporting 4chan by unblocking ads and purchasing a <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">4chan Pass</a>.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">JOINING THE FUTURE, ONE COMMIT AT A TIME by moot - 09/05/12 @ 2:00PM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#108" id="108" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>In May we launched a radical refactor of our frontend code, migrating 8 year old spaghetti HTML to code that validates HTML5/CSS3. The change was made to improve the rendering speed of large threads and consistency across browsers, and enable extension developers to more easily develop for the site. Along with the new code, we unveiled a responsive design with a mobile optimized view for phones, and also integrated a number of features from our Chrome extension directly into the site&mdash;specifically quick reply, quote previews, backlinking, and inline image expansion. These features alone make the site much more enjoyable to use, but there are many other great features that weren't included in our first pass.</p>

    <p>Today represents another radical change to our codebase, with the release of a full featured inline extension. It's also the first major change to the user-facing portion of the site since <a href="/news?all#95" target="_blank">December 2007</a>, when we overhauled the front page and imageboard themes. Almost every feature from our offical extension and other popular third-party extensions has been implemented natively into the site, and a handful have been enabled by default. Furthermore, the project is being <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS" target="_blank">posted publically to GitHub</a> and we're inviting the developer community to give us feedback and help make bug fixes and feature suggestions. The code is also being released under an open source, 3-clause BSD license&mdash;a first for us.</p>

    <p>My second announcement is another first&mdash;the release of a read-only JSON API. "4chan" and "API" are certainly two words I never thought I'd find in the same sentence, but alas, here we are. Beginning today, every thread will be rendered in JSON and accessible via http(s)://api.4chan.org/<strong>board</strong>/res/<strong>threadnumber</strong>.json</p>

    <p>The decision to release an API was <a href="/news/extensions" target="_blank">partially out of necessity</a>, but also because I'm curious to see how people will use it. The total number of official and third-party extension users numbers in the hundreds of thousands (roughly 1.5% of all visitors), and our native extension will reach all 22 million of 4chan's monthly visitors. This potentially has huge performance implications, and it's much more efficent to fetch JSON objects rather than scrape a full HTML page. The difference in filesize and performance is dramatic, with the a JSON representation of a thread being only 10-50% the size of the original HTML. A very crude documentation of the API can be found <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Before parting, I want to thank the people who made this possible. First, KING JAFFE JOFFER, who single-handedly took the initiative to refactor our HTML and did so with breakneck speed. He also ported our original Firefox extension to Chrome and has been doing a bunch behind the scenes improvements to our backend. Some will remember my recent announcement requesting "JavaScript wizards" contact me, and desuwa, creator of the popular Yotsuba Catalog, answered the call. desuwa completley blew away any expectations I had for this project, and was delightful to work with. I hope he'll remain a contributor to the project for a long time to come. And last but not least, both Mr VacBob and Kate deserve a huge thanks for helping maintain the site's servers over the years. The number of times they've stayed up until 5:00AM troubleshooting servers with me would require more than two hands, and I owe them a <em>lot</em> of lost slumber time.</p>

    <p>Thanks again to our awesome volunteers, and most importantly, you the community for making this all possible. I haven't been this excited in years.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: For those of you already using the official or third-party extensions, you'll need to disable your extension via your brower's Extensions/Add-ons menu, or disable the inline extension features by clicking [Settings] in the upper right-hand corner of the page, and selecting "Disable the extension".</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">BETTER MODERATION by moot - 09/03/12 @ 5:30PM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#107" id="107" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>In my <a href="/news?all#106">last news post</a>, I touched on an ongoing issue concerning a lack of consistent moderation.</p>

    <p>Over the years 4chan has grown considerably, but the team has not. More than 20 million people will visit 4chan in a given month, and of those visitors, 2 million will submit almost 25 million posts. In contrast, there are less than 50 volunteer moderators and janitors.</p>

    <p>Why the large gap? For one, it's hard to recruit from an anonymous community, since it can be difficult to identify the best contributors when you don't know who they are. Second, it's just not feasible to have hundreds or thousands of moderators and janitors due to the amount of time it takes to recruit, train, communicate with, and monitor their activities. To that end, instead of scaling the team over the years, we've focused on making moderation more efficient.</p>

    <p>Today I'm pleased to announce a big improvement we've made to our ban system. In the past, bans have been submitted individually by moderators, leading to widely inconsistent ban reasons and punishments. Although we do have guidelines in place, they don't cover every circumstance where a user might be banned, and require slow, tedious entry. Ideally, all of this should be automated&mdash;and now it is. Every global and board specific rule has been imported into a drop-down list in the ban panel, and moderators must now select from a set of pre-populated ban reasons and lengths, all of which are codified in the <a href="/rules" target="_blank">Rules</a>.</p>

    <p>By standardizing ban reasons and lengths and making sure they correspond to the posted rules, we hope to make life better for everyone on the site. Moderators can perform their tasks more efficiently, banned users will have more insight into why they were banned, and everyone will benefit from rule-infringing content and offenders being removed from the site more quickly.</p>

    <p>In addition to rolling out the revised ban system, we'll soon start accepting janitor applications. For those who are not aware, a janitor is a user who has the ability to view the reports queue, delete posts from their assigned board(s), and submit ban requests to moderators. We limit janitors to one or two boards in an attempt to select people who are knowledgeable and frequent visitors to the boards they're assigned. Ideally these people are some of the best contributors on a particular board and wish to make it a better place through both quality contribution and the ability to remove rule-infringing content. If you haven't read the <a href="/janitorapp" target="_blank">application page</a> yet and are interested in applying, I'd encourage you do so.</p>

    <p>We will begin accepting janitor applications on September 9th, and <strong>will only accept them for 24 hours</strong>. The application consists of a few pieces of information about yourself such as which boards you browse and what hours you're available to help out, and three long-form questions. All applications are blind screened by the team&mdash;we don't see your name, e-mail address, or other personal information during review. Because we received over 9,000 applications last time around, the entire process is expected to take weeks, and we ask that users <em>do not contact us to inquire about the status of their application</em>. Those who are selected to advance through the process will be notified by e-mail.</p>

    <p>Last month, we re-launched <span class="s">/q/ - 4chan Discussion</span>. It's been great to have a place to interact with the community one-on-one again, and I've thoroughly enjoyed reading through the feedback. We've yet to hold our first Q&amp;A session, but I plan to set aside a few hours on a weekend later this month to hang out, answer questions, and respond to your feedback. The thread will stay stickied for a week, so even if you miss out on participating in the discussion, you'll be able to read through it later.</p>

    <p>All in all, I hope these changes will address some of the community's concerns about moderation. It's important to remember that the moderators and janitors are people like you&mdash;people who actively use and care about 4chan. They've contributed an untold number of hours in an attempt to keep the site free of garbage, and do an excellent job given the challenges they face&mdash;reacting swifly and consistently, pleasing a rather vocal and unforgiving audience, and being severely outumbered by the userbase and constant stream of new posts.</p>

    <p>Thanks to them for their hard work, and thanks to you for your patience.</p>

    <p>As always, I can be reached by e-mail at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span> and on Twitter at @<a href="//twitter.com/moot" target="_blank">moot</a> and @<a href="//twitter.com/4chan" target="_blank">4chan</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Update</strong>: To clarify, moderators can still enter a custom reason or modify a ban template (reason, length, scope, etc), but are being encouraged to use the standardized ones when possible. If anything, the templates contain more lenient ban lengths and scopes than have been traditionally used. Again, the purpose of this change is to be more <em>consistent</em>&mdash;not more overbearing.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">BEYOND ONE BILLION by moot - 08/06/12 @ 1:45PM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#106" id="106" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>

    <p>With the exception of my note <a href="?all#extensions" target="_blank">On Extensions</a>, I haven't published a substantial news post since July 2008. It's certainly been an interesting and eventful four years, and I've written and re-written a number of updates that for one reason or another never saw the light of day (or <em>glow of basement</em>).</p>

    <p>Let's begin where we left off.</p>

    <p>In <strong>August 2008</strong> we moved our servers from Texas to California, which involved me renting an SUV and speeding across the desert with 4chan hurriedly loaded into my trunk. I made the trip with a friend and we managed a respectable 24 hours and 10 minutes from Dallas to Los Angeles. The move upgraded our maximum bandwidth throughput from 100Mbps to 1Gbps (later 10Gbps), and resulted in a noticeably faster site.</p>

    <p>As it turns out, fast has a downside. Back in <a href="?all#95">early 2008</a> I quoted our old server administrator saying "4chan consumes all bandwidth," and that once again proved to be the case. The resulting surge in bandwidth consumption more than doubled our operating costs, and with the wonderfully timed financial meltdown of 2008, 4chan came as close as it's ever been to going under. This resulted in the widely circulated $20,000 debt figure reported in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html">Washington Post profile</a> published in February 2009.</p>

    <p>I still have the drafts of <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/unpublishednewsposts.png" target="_blank">news posts</a> I wrote while laying awake in bed at 5:00 in the morning. Whatever I would have published, it wasn't a pretty picture.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2008, 4chan was accessed by 30 million unique visitors, and served 2.4 billion pageviews.</em></p>

    <p>Yet somehow we made it into <strong>2009</strong>, and things began to look up. Long plagued by an inability to attract mainstream advertising, I partnered with an individual who took over representing 4chan's ad inventory, and for the first time in years the site began to break even.</p>

    <p>April brought an amusing twist to an otherwise uneventful year, with the gaming of the 2009 TIME 100 poll. <a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/" target="_blank">This article</a> goes into what happened in greater detail, but I was proud to represent the 4chan community in the magazine and at the gala. It even spawned <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/trolling-is-a-art.jpg" target="_blank">an meme</a>.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of the year I purchased the first of what would eventually replace the site's aging Dell severs, which were procured following our "DONATE OR DIE 2005" donation drive. I also <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/oopsie.jpg" target="_blank">unplugged</a> the servers from the Internet for fun&mdash;sorry!</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2009, 4chan was accessed by 60 million unique visitors, and served 4.4 billion pageviews.</em></p>

    <p>Lev Grossman of TIME once compared 4chan to <em>Star Wars'</em> Mos Eisley and mused "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1821656,00.html" target="_blank">Spammers don't even bother to spam 4chan</a>." If only that held true. <strong>2010</strong> brought wave upon wave of spam in the form of JavaScript worms and affiliate link spammers, and the state of the boards reached a new low. After months of trying to mitigate the spam through various means, we resorted to implementing reCAPTCHA across the image boards, intending it to be a temporary fix. Fortunately, it was successful in blocking most automated attempts to spam the site, and immediately reduced the number of malicious images being uploaded to our servers. In fact it worked so well that we decided to make its addition permanent. While verifications can be a pain in the butt to fill out, the unfortunate truth is that 4chan represents a lucrative opportunity for spammers and malware authors. Without CAPTCHA and other measures in place, the site today would be completely overrun with spam as it was in 2010.</p>

    <p>Another big change came in the spring of 2010. In May I decided to take a leave of absence from school and start a new project, Canvas. I began working on Canvas to answer the question "What would forums look like if they were invented today?" The form, function, and aesthetic of the modern message board hasn't changed much since the days of Usenet and dial-up BBSes, and I wanted to take a crack at doing something new and different. What we ultimately launched is a community site with the concept of remix culture at its core, something I came to love after years of poking around 4chan MS Paint threads, and /b/ when it was still a fountain of original content.</p>

    <p>Many people have asked why I decided to start Canvas as a separate project instead of modernizing 4chan. The answer is simple: I, like you, enjoy 4chan the way it is. I thought it inappropriate and incompatible to change 4chan solely because I wanted to work on something new, and so Canvas spun off while 4chan remained the same.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2010, 4chan was accessed by 130 million unique visitors, and served 7.5 billion pageviews.</em></p>

    <p>In <strong>January 2011</strong>, I fucked up. Frustrated with /r9k/ and /new/, I removed them from the site. It took <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhjtocipcRU&amp;t=10m54s" target="_blank">this exchange</a> (continued <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R_xl2onS24" target="_blank">here</a>) months later with the founder of Encyclopedia Dramatica for me to realize how wrong I was. Shortly after, I re-added them and apologized to the community.</p>

    <p>In October I cosplayed Sigourney Weaver at the Web 2.0 Summit and gave a <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc" target="_blank">short talk on online identity</a> and <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzRYYTTcQpo" target="_blank">video interview</a> explaining some of the history of 4chan. If you're at all curious about my opinion on the modern web and 4chan, those might be a good place to start.</p>

    <p>November was a rough month. No stranger to distributed denial of service attacks, we were hit by one of the largest we've seen to date. This prompted the transition to using <a href="//www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>. I've <a href="/news/extensions" target="_blank">already explained</a> a bit about what CloudFlare does and does not do, but to recap, CloudFlare helps 4chan primarily in two ways: it caches and serves our images via a CDN that is distributed around the world, making the site load faster and reducing strain on our servers, and helps defend us against the aforementioned DDoS attacks.</p>

    <p>The transition was relatively painless, although we did experience a number of hiccups as we brought the site back online. Many of you encountered "Website Currently Unavailable" errors during this time, and have periodically since then. I want to be clear that almost every time you see these errors, the problem is on our end&mdash;not theirs. Since 4chan is run on a shoestring budget and with the help of few volunteers other than myself, things can and do go wrong. Believe me, I am just as lost as you are when the site is down, and always do my best to get it back up and running as soon as possible.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2011, 4chan was accessed by 190 million unique visitors, and served 7 billion pageviews.</em></p>

    <p><strong>2012</strong> got off to a good start. In May we re-wrote the image boards to be valid HTML5/CSS3&mdash;the first major change to the HTML in almost <em>nine years</em>. This was done to improve client-side performance and allow for the easy creation of user scripts and extensions, and enabled us to serve a pretty nifty <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chanmobile3.png" target="_blank">mobile site</a> too. We also added support for secure browsing via SSL, SPDY, and have made a number of improvements on the backend to make the site run faster than ever.</p>

    <p>On the heels of those improvements, last week 4chan crossed 1 billion total posts. Never in a million years would I have predicted reaching this milestone.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey; text-align: center;">This year, 4chan has been accessed by 134 million unique visitors, and served 4.5 billion pageviews.<br />Since 2008, it has been visited by more than 500 million people.</em></p>

    <p>Which brings us to the <strong>present</strong>. Where do we go from here?</p>

    <p>The most pressing issue facing the community is a lack of consistent moderation and communication from myself and the team. Sound familiar? That's because it was the same story <a href="?all#99" target="_blank">four years ago</a>. Before reading on, I highly encourage you read the linked news post.</p>

    <p>If you've been paying attention to the statistics woven into this post, you'll have noticed the site has grown considerably over the years. That growth has strained us in every way imaginable, and it shows. Four years ago, I proposed doing a sort of "Prime Minister's Questions," where users would have the opportunity to submit questions to be answered by myself and the moderators. Unfortunately it never came to pass, but the idea always stuck with me. After all, any thread I post in as "moot" tends to immediately devolve into an impromptu Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <p>Today I'm pleased to announce <span class="s">/q/ - 4chan Discussion</span>. Our earliest users will remember the "/q/ - Questions" image board from back in 2004, and the "/sug/ - Suggestions" discussion board from 2005-2006. Both served as a place where users could discuss the site amongst themselves and with the team, and in that spirit, I plan to host regularly scheduled Q&amp;A sessions (think PMQs) and use /q/ as a venue to interact with and collect feedback from the community.</p>

    <p>In addition to launching /q/, we'll be re-opening <a href="/janitorapp" target="_blank">janitor applications</a> in the coming weeks. For those who don't know, janitors are users who can access the reports queue and delete posts from their assigned board(s). They cannot ban users and are not full moderators. We debuted the janitor program some years ago to give dedicated members of the community the ability to clean up the boards they care about and visit frequently.</p>

    <p>I hope this news post is the first of many to come. While they can be daunting to write, you all deserve to be updated more than once every four years, and there are a few more things I look forward to announcing in the months ahead.</p>

    <p>Before I end, I want to explain why I still do this.</p>

    <p>I founded 4chan in 2003, when I was 15 years old. As of today, I've been running the site for almost 9 years, which represents more than one-third of my entire life. I have used 4chan daily since its inception and cannot imagine a life without it. As I said earlier&mdash;when 4chan goes down, I'm just as lost as the rest of you.</p>

    <p>I think of 4chan as a hobby and not a business. To that end, I don't operate it in a way that any sane business person would. I am proud of the fact that I've been able to provide the site free of charge, with minimal advertising and without annoying donation campaigns for almost seven years now. As I've said in the past, we do a lot with very little, and despite being constantly resource constrained, the site has flourished. None of this would have ever been possible without the thousands of hours of time generously given by our dedicated volunteers, and support of our loyal community.</p>

    <p>I have met countless people and made great friends through 4chan&mdash;Hell, I've even dated a few. For as bad a rap as 4channers can get from the outside world, my experience has been the exact opposite. While posting on the boards can sometimes be a crapshoot, every single person I've met on the street, at a meetup, conference, or for bubble tea has been <em>awesome</em>.</p>

    <p>This community has accomplished remarkable things. You have all impacted the Internet, mainstream culture, and history in a profound way. It has truly been a privilege and great honor to be a partcipant and witness to it all.</p>

    <p>I can honestly say I wouldn't trade these past eight and a half years for anything in the world. And for that, you all have my thanks.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">ON EXTENSIONS, USERSCRIPTS, AND ARCHIVERS by moot - 07/06/12 @ 1:00AM EDT</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#extensions" id="extensions" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p><em>Note: This post originally appeared on its own at http(s)://www.4chan.org/news/extensions, but has since been merged into our regular News archive.</em></p>
    <p>Today a few changes are being made to the popular 4chan X browser extension at my request.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">What changes were made?</p>
    <p>The most popular feature of every 4chan extension is automatic thread updating. Traditionally, 4chan X's default update interval has been 30 seconds, while allowing users to set this value as low as 1 second. Threads auto-updated at the set interval regardless of whether or not the tab had focus, and if the update had yielded any new posts.</p>
    <p>In 4chan X v2.34.0&mdash;released July 6th, 2012&mdash;the behavior for thread updating was modified. The changes are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The update interval is still set to 30 seconds, but the minimum interval has been increased from 1 second to 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>When a thread is inactive, the update interval will auto-increment. An inactive thread is one that has not received new posts upon being updated.</li>
    <li>The interval auto-increments in two different ways depending on whether or not the tab has focus or not. In inactive threads, the interval increases every time it updates the thread and no new posts have been made, up to a maximum of 90 seconds. For example, if you had a tab focused and no new posts were received after 5 seconds, the update interval would then increase to 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, if no new posts are received, it increases to 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, it increases to 20. After that, 30, 60, and then capping out at 90. It takes roughly 4 minutes to reach the maximum interval.</li>
    <li><em>But what if the thread becomes active again?</em> The extension accounts for this, and every time a new post is received, the update interval is reset to the one you've specified. So let's say there are no new posts for a few minutes, and the interval has increased to 30 seconds&mdash;if a new post comes in, the interval is reset to the one you've chosen and the process starts all over again.</li>
    <li>Background (unfocused) tabs are slightly different. The interval increases just like a focused tab, but the cap is higher and will continue from 90 seconds to 120, 300, and finally 600 seconds. <strong>However, this timer resets once the tab regains focus.</strong> For example, if an unfocused tab has its timer increased to 120 seconds after ~6 minutes of inactivity, the moment you select the tab, the timer immediately resets to your specified interval, and then updates as a focused tab would, capping out at 90 seconds in the event the thread becomes inactive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why were these changes made?</p>
    <p>It's important to understand what happens every time a thread is automatically refreshed by an extension. When the timer hits 0, a request is made to 4chan's server. In years past, extensions would re-download the entire page, parse it for new posts, and then display those new posts. In December, 4chan X was updated to first check a thread's Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since headers before fetching the page, which saves us bandwidth and server strain, but does not eliminate the issue entirely. The issue we're grappling with right now is that with the influx of people using 4chan extensions and userscripts, our servers are being <em>slaughtered</em> with page requests, and although less bandwidth is being transferred, it is still tying up connections and worker processes.</p>
    <p>Let's put things in perspective. According to Google Analytics, in the past 30 days (June 4 - July 4, 2012) 4chan has been visited by approximately <strong>22 million unique visitors</strong>, and served <strong>620 million page views</strong> to those visitors.</p>
    <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/googleanalytics-20120705.png" alt="googleanalytics-20120705.png" title="Google Analytics, June 4 - July 4, 2012" style="display: block; margin: auto; border: 1px dashed;"/>
    <p>If anything, this number is low because many 4channers use extensions like AdBlock and NoScript to block Google Analytics' tag. Because CloudFlare <em>proxies</em> all of 4chan's page requests, we can get a more accurate number from them.</p>
    <p>In the past 30 days, CloudFlare has proxied <strong>1,331,004,996 page views</strong> from 4chan. This represents every HTML request that has passed through their servers to ours. In addition to that, CloudFlare has proxied and <strong>served 1,350 TB of content</strong>, which combined with our backend transfer of ~300 TB, means <strong>we've served 1.65 petabytes, or 1,650,000 GB of data in the past 30 days</strong>.</p>
    <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/cloudflare-20120705.png" alt="cloudflare-20120705.png" title="CloudFlare, June 4 - July 4, 2012" style="display: block; margin: auto; border: 1px dashed;"/>
    <p>Notice that I say <em>proxied</em> and not <em>cached</em>. <em><strong>CloudFlare does not cache HTML&mdash;every connection/request for HTML is passed on to our servers, and our server must send a response.</strong></em></p>
    <p>In an average day, <strong>1.4 million people will visit 4chan</strong>, and there will be <strong>more than 1 million posts submitted</strong>. At any given moment in time, there are between 25,000 and 35,000 browsing the site. Approximately 50,000 people have downloaded 4chan X. Let's figure there are about 500 to 1,000 people browsing 4chan with 4chan X (or any other extension&mdash;a conservative estimate) at any given moment, with thread updating enabled (the default). Let's say half of them have modified their update interval to be a bit lower, between 1 and 15 seconds. And let's say most of them have at least 2 or 3 tabs open.</p>
    <p>I hope you understand where we're going with this. Every minute, these extensions and their auto updaters account for thousands upon thousands of connections and page requests to our servers.</p>
    <p>This is <em><strong>extremely wasteful</strong></em> of our limited resources given that the <em>majority</em> of threads do not need to be updated more frequently than 5-15 seconds, nor do backgrounded threads.</p>
    <p>As an aside, I want to quickly clarify what CloudFlare does and doesn't do. CloudFlare sits between you and our servers, and essentially proxies every request to 4chan. What does this do? For one thing, it allows us to serve you cached resources such as images from a datacenter much closer to your home. CloudFlare also provides added security against denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and is sometimes able to serve cached pages should one of our servers go down.</p>
    <p>Using CloudFlare still requires we host the site though, using our own servers, which becomes the "backend." We're responsible for running the application, storing images and static resources, serving images that have not been cached yet or expired from cache, serving all HTML, maintaining the database, etc. We pay for these servers, rackspace, power, and bandwidth. We pay for CloudFlare too. While they offer free and $20 "Pro" plans for most of their customers, large businesses and enterprise customers are a different ballgame. It isn't cheap&mdash;far from it.</p>
    <p>In recent months, given the increase in popularity of extensions and re-introduction of certain features like "image preloading," we've seen our backend bandwidth <em>double</em>. This means the bill has doubled too. We've also seen our image server's RAID array go from being relatively idle to getting absolutely <em>slammed</em>. Why? Because despite having a bunch of fast drives in RAID 10 and 64 GB of RAM, our image server simply cannot keep up. CloudFlare does not keep every resource cached indefinitely (there is a time-to-live, or TTL), so both new images and many old images result in cache misses that require their servers fetch the resource from our backend. Again, with the re-introduction of image preloading and well, <em>summer</em>, this has put an increased strain on our servers, our very limited resources, and my wallet.</p>
    <p>And so I've asked that extension developers make small changes in light of these challenges.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Where do we go from here?</p>
    <p>I think the fact that 4chan has a thriving third-party extension and userscript community is awesome. We launched our official extension more than 6 years ago, and the ecosystem has grown from 1 to 100's of add-ons.</p>
    <p>I believe that the vast majority of these developers mean well, but I also believe that many do not understand the ramifications that seemingly small changes have on 4chan as a whole. 4chan is a website that operates at large scale on a shoe-string budget. Most people simply don't have experience operating, nor scaling a very large website, and as a result don't see things the same way I do.</p>
    <p>What I'm asking from extension developers and users alike is simple: be reasonable. To be frank, threads do not need updating every second. 99% of threads do not even warrant being updated at 5 seconds, but I'll respect that many would consider any longer to be "too long."</p>
    <p>The changes that I've requested are reasonable considering our position. The entire userbase should not need to suffer slow pages, downtime, and the risk that I'll go broke from rapidly increasing operating costs because a select few users feel the need to refresh every thread in every tab once per second, or open every image in a thread regardless of whether or not they mean to look at them.</p>
    <p><strong>tl;dr for extension and userscript developers:</strong> Please be reasonable about defaults and always use headers like Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since when possible.<br />
    <strong>tl;dr for 4channers who use extensions and userscripts:</strong> Please be reasonable about your update intervals, and use of bandwidth intensive features like preloading, auto-GIF, expand-all, etc. And try to appreciate our position here&mdash;we do the best we can given our limited resources. I've always tried to provide users with the best possible user experience, for free, and will continue to do so.</p>
    <p>And that's that. It's been a while since I've written something as long as this. In light of the fact that I haven't updated the <a href="//www.4chan.org/news">News</a> page in 4 years, and 4chan's upcoming <strong>1 billionth post</strong>, I plan to write something more comprehensive in the coming weeks.</p>
    <p>Which makes me realize, the site is going on <strong>9 years old</strong>, which represents more than one-third of my entire <em>life</em>.</p>
    <p>It's been a hell of a ride&mdash;that's for sure.</p>

    <p>Back in late May, I was asked by TIME's Lev Grossman about "when [I] 
    realized that the whole 4chan phenomenon was getting out of control." My response, taken 
    from his blog entry, 
    "<a href="http://techland.time.com/2008/07/10/now_in_papervision_the_4chan_g/">Now in Paper-Vision: The 4chan Guy</a>":</p>
    <p><blockquote>I guess when the GETs stopped having meaning. Every million posts is a 
    'GET'. So people will try to attain that post number, to 'get' the GET, as it were. 
    1M GET and 2M GET were these big deals. People would camp out and wait around&mdash;they 
    would make a note in their head, "OK, I think the GET's going to go down tomorrow." But that's 
    when [4chan's] post rate was maybe 10,000 posts per day. Now the post rate is something 
    like 150 to 200,000 posts on the '/b/ - Random' board alone. And so GETs happen every few 
    weeks. They've lost their meaning. Nobody even remembers. Usually they would spawn a meme, 
    just because they were that post number.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Why do I feel this quote is noteworthy? In my eyes, the erosion of the long-standing 
    tradition of "<a href="/faq#get">GETs</a>" epitomizes some of the issues 
    we're now dealing with.</p>
    <p>Simply put, we've got too many people trying to participate in too many discussions 
    at once. 4chan, especially /b/, is a place with little homogeny and nary a consensus. 
    As 4chan's traffic has grown exponentially over the years, our software, and its 
    functionality, has not. In a way, we're still using the same web site we were almost 
    five years ago. Attempting to cram <a title="OVER 9000">several million</a> of you into 
    one single image board has produced some pretty amazing things over time, but also... 
    "cancer."</p>
    <p>So what are we going to do about it? The following are a few of the solutions I currently 
    have in mind:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Split up the board</strong>: Following 
    <a href="http://www.2chan.net">2chan</a>'s lead with 
    <a href="http://img.2chan.net/b/futaba.htm">Nijiura</a>, /b/ would be seperated in to 
    several boards. 2chan presently has <em>six</em> Nijiura boards. Providing two versions 
    of /b/&mdash;one with named posting enabled, and one with forced anonymity, is also an 
    idea. One major concern with this proposal is that it would further spread out our 
    already overtaxed moderation staff. Obviously, we can add more moderators, but that's 
    always proved far easier said than done.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>More visible moderation</strong>: During what many consider to be /b/'s 
    "glory" days, it was not uncommon to see a trail of 
    "<span class="redb">(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</span>" strewn across the board. 
    There was once a time when "MODS" didn't equal "FAGS", but rather, "GODS". I hereby 
    announce my intention to return to these times. I've long held that "Random" should be 
    left more or less entirely to its own devices, but frankly, you 
    <span class="s">sometimes</span> often need us here to keep the 
    <a title="read: cancer">crap</a> at bay.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A "sage"-like function that actually works</strong>: sage has been 
    misunderstood for ages&mdash;its primary function is <em>not</em> thread voting. Implementing 
    a form of user moderation that actually impacts the content of the board, separate from the 
    current reports system, ranks high on the list of possibilities.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Work will begin on implementing these changes as soon as possible. As I've said 
    before: "Try to remain patient; good things take time."</p>

    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>Recently, I've received quite a few inquiries regarding our plans for 
    <a href="http://www.otakon.com">Otakon</a> this year. As you may or may not already know, we've 
    previously thrown three hugely successful <a href="faq#holdevent">events</a> at Otakon in 
    <span class="s">2005</span>, 
    <span class="s">2006</span>, and 
    <span class="s">2007</span>. Over the years, I've greatly 
    enjoyed the opportunity to host these panels, however, it seems that our streak has finally come 
    to an end.</p>
    <p>It is with regret that I must inform you we will <em>not</em> be holding a 4chan panel at 
    Otakon 2008. Numerous e-mails to the staff, including the con-chair, Sean "Hellbuny" Chiochankitmun, 
    who graciously worked with us this past year, have gone unanswered. Frankly [for better or for worse], 
    the odds of the site having any sort of presence at Otakon this year are slim to none. Should Otakon choose 
    to address this matter and reverse their decision, we would be more than happy to attend. After all, we did 
    manage to scramble and make it to their convention last year with just a little over one week's notice!</p>
    <p>I'll keep everybody posted, but I don't expect a resolution at this point. My apologies to all those 
    who are disappointed by this news. Unfortunately, the decision is out of my hands.</p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: Back in April I had the privilege of attending 
    <a href="http://www.roflcon.org">ROFLCon</a>, held at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conference 
    was a blast and I heartily recommend it to anyone for next year, providing it is held. I represented 
    4chan on the 
    "<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/RespectablyFrench.ROFLCon.Internet_Cult_Leader">Internet Cult Leaders</a>" 
    panel, alongside Randall Munroe (xkcd), and Ryan North (Dinosaur Comics, Project Wonderful). It's now looking 
    like this might be the closest thing we'll get to a panel in 2008. Oh well&mdash;enjoy!</p>
    <p><strong>Update</strong>: Sean sent me an e-mail shortly after this news post went up. 
    He briefly clarified Otakorp's position on having 4chan present at Otakon 2008, but in the end, the 
    situation has <em>not</em> changed. This 
    <a href="http://board.otakon.com/index.php?showtopic=15005">thread</a> over at the Otakon Web Boards 
    sheds some light on the matter.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">ALL THINGS CONSIDERED by moot
    - 06/26/08 @ 5:35AM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#99" id="99"
    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>I've had the following subject on my mind for quite some time now, and recent events 
    have pushed me towards writing about it sooner rather than later. The theme of this news 
    post is "communication" (or a lack thereof).</p>
    <p>One of my biggest regrets stemming from running 4chan these past few years has been 
    allowing my level of interaction with the userbase to decline to the point where it stands 
    today. I'm still here, every day&mdash;reading e-mails, browsing the boards, removing 
    rule-infringing content, and of course, summoning the banhammer. As are the moderators. 
    But <em>you</em>, the end user, don't know that. 4chan is by design not the most transparent 
    of websites. If our team isn't continually engaging the community and relating what's going 
    on behind the scenes, you simply don't know. And that's a problem.</p>
    <p>Some of this has been intentional. I've always strongly believed that moderation should 
    remain in the background and seldom seen, as its purpose is not to influence discussion 
    outright, but rather to ensure it remains focused and uninterrupted. Blatant moderation 
    can be detrimental to the conversation at hand, however, it also provides a sometimes 
    necessary "we're watching" factor. In addition, I've increasingly refrained from posting under 
    my "moot" moniker, because it often comes at the expense of a thread, which tend to derail 
    almost immediately after I respond.</p>
    <p>The growing disconnect between the administration and 4chan's community has led to a 
    large amount of misinformation being circulated throughout the boards. The common assertions 
    that there aren't ever any active moderators, that I'm never around, and "hate" 4chan, 
    or /b/ more specifically, are entirely false, and have become rather frustrating to see 
    repeated so frequently. The continued presence of these misconceptions on the site is 
    however, my fault, considering I've allowed entire generations of 4channers to go without 
    seeing myself or the moderators interact with the community. News posts have dwindled 
    from weekly updates to semiannual affairs. The 
    DevBlog was introduced over two years ago 
    to provide a place for us to post frequent, informal updates, but if you take a look 
    at it, you'll quickly find that things didn't really work out as planned. Granted, I've 
    used tools such as the global message, 
    <a href="/blotter?all">blotter</a>, and stickies to communicate 
    instead, but who here remembers the days of our IRC town hall meetings, 
    <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/q-lain.png">/q/ - Questions</a>, or the 
    <a title="Who the hell is Seem, and WTF is he doing?">/sug/ discussion board</a>? 
    I'd be surprised if at this point there are many users left who actually remember these 
    relics from a time when the staff seemed collectively more helpful and 
    approachable&mdash;heck, even likable!</p>
    <p>I've identified what I feel is a large and growing issue, so the question is, how 
    are we going to address it? What I propose, is a system similar to Britain's 
    "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Questions">Prime Minister's Questions</a>". 
    The idea is that much like PMQs, users will be given the opportunity to submit questions weekly 
    or bi-weekly, to be responded to on the DevBlog. With this system, you'll have the chance to 
    have your questions answered directly, publicly for all to see, straight from the horse's 
    mouth. Other ideas I've been toying around with include embedding a meebo 
    widget or chat room onto a contact page, to give users 
    instant access to the staff and myself (providing we're online and logged in), and using 
    a SHOUTcast relay or streaming video service to host live, annual broadcasts pertaining 
    to the site. Look for more info regarding these additions in the coming 
    <span class="s">days</span> weeks.</p>
    <p>Past all of this, there are two other major concerns on my mind right now: janitors and 
    the state of /b/.</p>
    <p>We have still yet to roll out additional janitors. Sorting through almost two thousand 
    applications is taking much longer than expected, and I sincerely apologize to both the 
    applicants and community for the delay. As I stated back in 
    <a href="?all#95">February</a> and 
    <a href="?all#98">April</a>, it is our goal to have more 
    janitors and moderators present to help improve the quality of discussion, as well as 
    increase response rate and coverage. I understand that certain boards have been going 
    downhill recently, while others desperately need a clean up. I am aware of it and am 
    working towards accomplishing this goal as swiftly as possible.</p>
    <p>Second, there is /b/. I will be dedicating an entire news post to this soon, but 
    to quickly touch on things: <a href="//boards.4chan.org/b/">Random</a> 
    (and 4chan in general), has its fair share of problems. Unfortunately, they're not the 
    types with overnight solutions. These problems run much too deep to be dealt  a quick 
    fix. I've been mulling over this past week in detail and believe I'll have arrived at 
    some sort of conclusion soon. Make no mistake, I am not rushing to a solution. Try to 
    remain patient; good things take time. To dispel any rumors right off the bat: /b/ is not 
    going anywhere. It will not be shut down.</p>
    <p>Moving forward once more, I intend to begin making up for lost time immediately. 
    Life has been extremely hectic for me these past two months, and I haven't been able to 
    dedicate nearly as much time to the site as I would have liked. Over the summer I hope to 
    commit the majority of my free time to 4chan and related work. With any luck, we'll start 
    making progress shortly.</p>
    <p>As always, feel free to weigh in on what I've written via e-mail. My standard e-mail disclaimer: I can 
    guarantee I'll read your message, but <em>do not expect a response</em>.</p>
    <p>In closing, take care, enjoy the summer, and stay tuned!</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Addendum</strong>: I've given more thought to my e-mail situation, and 
    I'm pretty much on the verge of declaring e-mail bankruptcy. 
    If you've sent me a message prior to this news post and haven't received a response yet, 
    don't expect one. From this point forward, however, I'll be making more of an effort to 
    respond to e-mail in a timely fashion&mdash;that is, providing the e-mail warrants a 
    response to begin with. Let's see how long I last.</p>

    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>Time to break down some recent happenings:</p>
    <ul>
	<li><p>In my last news post, I touched on the fact that 4chan was almost ranked as the 5th 
	largest community on the 'Net. It took a month, but yesterday, we 
	<a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/bigboards-5th.png">moved past</a> the VN Boards and 
	secured spot number five, with over 117.6M posts and counting! Next up on the list is 
	FaceTheJury, which if we maintain our current post rate, will be dethroned in just about 
	thirteen weeks.</p></li>
	<li><p>This past April Fool's Day, five gigantic websites ran pranks based on 4chan 
	memes&mdash;<a href="//www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com">GameFAQs</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.deviantart.com">deviantART</a>, and 
	<a href="http://www.isohunt.com">isoHunt</a>. If examples such as these don't testify to 
	4chan's enormous (and often undetected) cultural impact on the Web, then I don't know 
	<em>what</em> does. Rupert Murdoch, eat your heart out.</p></li>
	<li><p>One month ago we introduced two new themes for the image boards: Yotsuba &amp; Yotsuba 
	Blue. After over four years of browsing 4chan with the same old themes, I decided that we 
	could use a couple of additional, <em>optional</em> style sheets. The additions will serve 
	to help unify the look and feel of the site between the new front page design, and the image 
	boards, as well as provide an enhanced user experience. Thus far, I've received nothing but 
	praise for them, and personally, I'm very pleased with how they turned out. Many thanks to 
	coda for whipping these up, and the rest of the team for providing feedback.</p></li>
	<li><p>Progress on the janitor recruitment front is coming along, albeit slowly. The process 
	is rather involving, and I've recently had little time to commit to it. Rest assured, rolling 
	out new janitors still remains a high priority, and I expect it to be completed some time 
	in May.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Next update, I'll weigh in on the performance of the trial boards, and hopefully announce 
	some of our future plans.</p>

    <p>The most obvious change over these past few weeks has been the addition of new trial 
    boards. Nine in total were added, which include: 
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/fa/" title="Fashion">Fashion</a>, 
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/fit/" title="Health &amp; Fitness">Health &amp; Fitness</a>,

    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/r9k/" title="ROBOT9000">ROBOT9000</a>. 
    We've received a lot of requests for new boards over the course of this past year, 
    and were unfortunately unable to honor them all. That said, I believe these additions 
    represent a healthy range of new topics, and wish them the best.</p>
    <p>I'd like to take a moment and reiterate that these boards have been added on a 
    <em>trial</em> basis. We encourage users to visit them and if interested, contribute! 
    The factors that determine whether or not a trial board will remain aren't exactly set 
    in stone, but popularity is definitely one of them. The more active participants and 
    comments a trial board receives, the less likely it is to be removed.</p>
    <p>Aside from adding new sections, we've tweaked a number of limits across the image boards. 
    The global maximum file size, reply, and image reply limits have all been raised. The worksafe 
    boards have also had their  pruning method changed from time based to popularity based, 
    in order to facilitate more long term discussion.</p>
    <p>I've received a lot of great e-mails since my last update on 
    February 12<sup style="vertical-align: top;">th</sup>. My thanks goes to those who took the 
    time to write me a message&mdash;it is appreciated. One question shared by many was: 
    "How do I volunteer to become a janitor or moderator?". This has already been answered 
    in the <a href="/faq#volunteer" title="4chan FAQ">FAQ</a>, but I'll 
    repeat it here. First of all, applications are only accepted occasionally. If there is no 
    posted recruitment taking place, you cannot apply. Second, applications are handled online 
    only, and not via e-mail. Last, we don't take any requests to become a moderator. Admission 
    is granted by invite only. These policies have been in place for quite some time, and it 
    is unlikely that they will change any time soon.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, we'll be accepting janitor applications in just a few days time. 
    If you're interested in applying for a janitor position, 
    <a href="/janitorapp" title="4chan Janitor Application">visit this page</a>. 
    It contains all of the necessary info, and come March 6<sup style="vertical-align: top;">th</sup>, 
    will contain the application form itself. Be sure to mark your calendar!</p>
    <p>One last thing: Did anybody else notice that 4chan recently passed the 100M post mark? 
    One hundred million. One tenth of one billion. According to 
    <span class="s">this</span>, 4chan is almost the 5th 
    largest bulletin board on the Web. Many might not realize it, but at any given point in 
    time, tens of thousands of users from across the globe are browsing this site. It's incredible, 
    if you ask me.</p>
    <p>That's it for now. Enjoy the new additions!</p>

    <p>It's been over a year since I've written anything substantial for the front page. Life has 
    taken its toll on my free time, and while I still somehow manage to find time to work on 4chan 
    each day, that time is spent working on knocking things off of our neverending to-do list, 
    and not writing news posts. The very thought of writing these next few paragraphs is daunting, 
    for we have much to discuss.</p>
    <p>First and foremost, the most shocking change over this past year has been the overhaul 
    of <a href="/" title="4chan">www.4chan.org</a>. In December, 
    we launched the third revision of the main site, which was initially met with some dissent. 
    While I understand the change was unwelcome to some, it was a necessary step forward for the 
    site. To sum up my feelings on it: there is now something, where there was previously nothing. 
    The old front page contained little to no useful information; it was cryptic and outdated. To 
    the casual observer, 4chan was a peach colored page containing links that had something to do 
    with cats and cake. Since the news has not been regularly updated, pictures tended to sit on the 
    main page for months at a time, which quickly became a waste of bandwidth, and useful space. 
    And now that's all changed&mdash;instead of <em>nothing</em>, there is now <em>something</em>. 
    We offer dynamic content consisting of recent images, popular threads, and the latest posts. 
    Apart from the cries of "Web 2.0!", I have yet to read a compelling argument against the new 
    design, and thus, it will remain. 4chan's front page is now both intuitive and useful, 
    something that it has lacked for years.</p>
    <p>Speaking of "years", 4chan is now going on its fifth birthday. Five years ago, I couldn't 
    have imagined the world as it is today, much less 4chan. Who'd have thought we'd make it 
    this far? I certainly didn't. The internet has become ubiquitous, and hundreds of English 
    image boards now exist, with millions of users across the globe visiting them daily. 
    And that all started here, with 4chan. In January alone, we served almost 2,700,000 users 
    from over two hundred different countries. Our Alexa 
    <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/4chan.org">ranking</a>
    has continued to climb, with us now being placed within 
    the top 500 sites on the entire internet. The word is out. Almost everybody subscribing to any 
    sort of geek culture has heard of or used 4chan by now&mdash;and to think, just under four and 
    a half years ago, we were but a drop in the ocean. Now, the concept of "Anonymous" is taking the 
    world by storm.</p>
    <p>With such explosive growth, we've gone through so many growing pains. Forget 
    "<a href="?all#78">DONATE OR DIE</a>", who remembers the 
    YowCow days? Money, servers, moderators and janitors&mdash;4chan seems to blow through it all. 
    But still, here we stand, alive as ever.</p>
    <p>Looking forward has always been important to me. 4chan today is not as it was four years 
    ago, and it will not exist in the future as it does today. Times change, and so have we. 
    There has been a lot of rumbling on 
    /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/b/" title="Random">b</a>/ [and the rest of the 
    site] for the past few months, heck&mdash;years, about the quality of posts on the board(s). 
    As we all know, there is no barrier to posting on 4chan. We don't have mandatory user 
    registration, and God willing, never will. I've said in the past that "any retard with 
    half a brain and a keyboard can post on 4chan", and that level of accessibility has produced 
    mixed results.</p>
    <p>The site is great because anybody can 
    jump in and start using it, which has generated some amazing content, but also, a perpetual 
    stream of garbage. Honestly, I don't know what the solution is. I'd like to keep the site as 
    open to all users as possible (yes, that includes new ones too), while still enforcing a  
    minimum quality standard. This can't be resolved via posting limitations and moderation alone; 
    there is a very large component of it that needs to come from the userbase itself. For as many 
    changes as I've made to /b/, hit and miss as they might have been, I still firmly believe 
    that the real power to change lies within the users themselves. The 4chan staff doesn't 
    generate the content on this site&mdash;you do. We provide the framework, and the community 
    provides the rest.</p>
    <p>Still, there are things that Team 4chan could be doing that we aren't, be it due to a lack 
    of resources, or just plain apathy. Moderating is often a demanding, unrewarding, 
    and thankless task. Trolls constantly hound the moderators for doing too much, or too 
    little. It seems almost impossible to strike that perfect balance that our users seek, and it's 
    something that's eluded us for some time now. Part of the problem is that there are so many 
    of you, and too few of us. Having thirty people policing almost three million creates 
    some pretty unfavorable odds. We've given users the ability to help moderate the site 
    themselves, with the report button. While this feature has played a crucial role in increasing 
    our response time to problem posts, it's been a nightmare dealing with the sheer number of 
    threads that require review. The internal tools we have at our disposal are showing their age, 
    and major changes are coming in the future to help curb the various issues we're facing. 
    Over the next few months, we hope to expand the janitor staff considerably, while also picking 
    up some fresh moderators along the way. The goal is to keep the site relevant to the 
    interests of our loyal userbase. I don't think countless pages of one-word responses and 
    regurgitated memes are relevant to anything, even on /b/. Keep in mind, our intent is not 
    to suppress the voices of the users, but rather to foster the type of quality discussion 
    that has been lacking for quite some time.</p>
    <p>coda and I have spent the past week rolling out changes across the servers to 
    increase performance. We have more ambitious future plans, but for now, our current 
    tweaks should suffice. Hopefully, users will notice drastically improved response times and 
    snappier page loads. We've gone from pushing approximately 350mbps 
    to <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/traffic.feb5-12.png">almost 500mbps</a> in just a few 
    days time. User experience has always been extremely important to us, and I hope 4channers 
    will appreciate these improvements. In addition to the new quickness, we've increased the 
    page limit on a number of boards from 6 to 11. Up until now, we haven't had the resources 
    available to make this change. Again owing to a lack of resources, we haven't added very 
    many boards over the past year. Soon, I intend to introduce a number of new boards to decrease 
    the number of voids left in our current offering. Some of the ideas we're currently tossing 
    around include: Toys, Health &amp; Fitness, Travel, and two old friends&mdash;Sports and 
    Trains!</p>
    <p>Long ago, our old server admin, DJ Lucid, once quipped to me: 
    "4chan consumes all bandwidth". I remember scoffing at his prediction 
    that we'd be using up a full 100mbps link within a matter of months, but he was right. As 
    the site has grown, so have the demands on its bank account. 4chan requires a boatload of 
    cash to run, because, quite frankly, we're huge! We've long since shed the notion of recouping 
    costs through donations, and instead turned to ad revenue for covering operating expenditures. 
    Our entry into the wild and not-so-wonderful world of advertising has been mixed. We've added 
    more ad positions to the site over the years to offset rising overhead and been bounced around 
    between so many ad networks and account managers that I'd be hard pressed to list them all. 
    But we've succeeded&mdash;4chan is still here, after all.</p>
    <p>Users may have noticed that our long 
    standing relationship with <a href="http://www.jlist.com/">J-List</a> came to an end recently, 
    with their familiar leaderboard and vertical banners being removed a few days ago. The 
    separation was mutual, and we wish Peter the best of luck with his business. We look forward 
    to forming relationships with new companies to fill our ad inventory with brands and products 
    relevant to our users. Ads are important to 4chan, but the users will always be placed 
    first. I understand that the average college student browsing 
    /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/a/" title="Anime &amp; Manga">a</a>/ is not 
    interested in punching the monkey to win a free &lt;insert-gimmick-product-here&gt;, just as 
    those who browse 
    /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/ck/" title="Food &amp; Cooking">ck</a>/ aren't 
    interested in refinancing their home. Unfortunately, untargetted ads are the 
    price we've paid for using what I refer to as "big-box ad networks" over the years. 
    I am making a concentrated effort to transition our inventory 
    to direct ad sales, whereby we can more easily select sites that we know our users will be 
    interested in doing business with. We ask that you bear with us here, and 
    support our move. Ads will return shortly, as we begin to populate the positions 
    with new advertisers. Please consider supporting the site by unblocking ads and 
    visiting our sponsors, because they play a large role in keeping this behemoth afloat.</p>
    <p>Enough about all that though&mdash;back to the big picture. What I want users to take 
    from this gigantic pile of words is that I'm still here and excited as ever to be working on 
    4chan. We have a lot in store for the site in the coming months. As I've said in 
    the past, stagnation is not acceptable, and 4chan will continue to make strides forward in 
    development. For a site that's essentially just "pictures and text", 4chan has become 
    so much more, and I'm proud of what we as a community have accomplished in what will soon be 
    five years. Thank you for continuing to be a part of it.</p>
    <p>As always, I can be reached at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span>. 
    Questions/comments/concerns/suggestions are always welcome. If you've made it this far, 
    I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

    <p>As you may or may not have noticed, the global message
    and <a href="/blotter?all">blotter</a> have been updated to
    announce <strong><em>4chan: The Otakon 2007 Panel</em></strong>. We're
    returning to <a href="http://www.otakon.com">Otakon</a> (July 20 - 22, 2007 /
    Baltimore, MD) for our third year in a row, and the convention is now only <em>one
    day</em> away! The panel is scheduled for <span><strong>Saturday, from
    10:30PM until 12:00AM, in "Panels 4".</strong></span> Like our previous panels, it's
    open to all ages.</p>
    <p>A few important notes: We've been given "Panels 4", this year's largest gathering
    space. I'm told it can hold anywhere between 850 and 1,000 people, which will
    hopefully [but probably not] be enough. <em>Show up early</em> if you want
    better odds at being seated in the audience. In both years we've hosted an event at
    Otakon, people have been turned away from the line and at the door due to the room
    reaching capacity. If this happens to you, try returning at midnight and join us for
    AFTERMATH, which will be held after the panel outside of the convention center. One
    of the largest challenges we faced last year was line containment. While waiting in
    line, keep to yourself as much as possible and avoid blocking the hallway. In the
    ballroom we want our audience to be energetic, but safe as well. So long as everybody
    uses some common sense, we don't anticipate there will be any problems this year.
    Remember: Otakon staffers can and will remove you from the convention if they believe
    your actions to be a threat to others' safety.</p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: My apologies for announcing the panel so late this year,
    but the offer came without warning only a week ago. If you're attending Otakon this
    year, COME TO OUR PANEL! As per usual, we'll have commemorative buttons on hand to
    give away to those who show up. Last year was a blast, and we hope to build on that
    great experience for 2007. See you there!</p>

    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>First of all, "Happy New Year!" from all of us here at
    4chan. We hope that 2007 brings good fortune to our users and this website. The
    following is going to serve as both an update to where we left off in November, and
    an introduction to a few changes we're going to be rolling out shortly.</p>
    <p>Regarding our switch over to AdBrite ads in December&mdash;things have been going pretty
    well. We need a few things to change though. Way too many people are blocking these
    ads, and too few are supporting our sponsors. If you see an ad relevant to your
    interests, click on it and visit the site! Our click-thru rate (CTR) is so low that,
    unless things start turning around, we'll be required to terminate our ad campaign
    with AdBrite. If this happens, our financial situation is going to go downhill,
    <em>fast</em>. Because of this, <em>we once again urge that all users
    unblock ads from AdBrite.com, and 4chan.org</em>. In addition, <em>we ask
    that users start supporting our sponsors, by clicking advertisements relevant to
    their interests</em>. Over these past three years, we've *always* put a strong
    emphasis on choosing ads that we believe our users would respond well to, and these
    ads are no exception.</p>
    <p>While this next change may seem like a departure from that motive, it is a necessary
    addition that we feel will greatly benefit 4chan. Soon, we're going to be introducing
    an "active interstitial" advertisement to the imageboards. An example of the
    advertisement can be viewed <span class="s">here</span>. The ad
    will only display once per day, per user, and <em>only</em> when an image thumbnail
    is clicked. You will not receive this ad on page indexes, nor images accessed via
    direct link (ie. by clicking the filename linked above the thumbnail). Image archival
    programs will not lose their functionality. Also, if you absolutely abhor these ads,
    or otherwise do not wish to support 4chan, you don't need to see them! Merely click
    the filename link as opposed to the thumbnail. Honestly, I think that sites like IGN
    have ruined the idea of a tolerable interstitial for all of us, but we've gone to
    great lengths to make these ads as painless and unobtrusive as possible. To
    reiterate: <em>you will only see this ad once per day, and only when you
    click on an image thumbnail</em>. If this change weren't absolutely necessary, we
    wouldn't be doing it. Unfortunately, <em>it is</em>. We trust that the community will
    be supportive of our decision.</p>
    <p>In other news, we've applied some tweaks to our servers, so things should be a bit
    more responsive. We're still maxing out our 100mbps link though; at this point there
    isn't much left we can do to speed things up without additional bandwidth.
    Thankfully, we're already hard at work upgrading our current infrastructure and
    internet connection. Providing we keep receiving continued support from the
    community, you can expect good things from us in the near future.</p>
    <p>Last, you may have noticed the trial boards are no longer italicized. With the
    exception of the "/sp/ - Sports" board, all boards have made it through their trial
    phase and are now to be considered permanent additions. Be sure to read the updates
    <a href="/rules">rules</a> so you don't accidentally break
    them!</p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: DamageInc's extension has been updated to account for these new
    changes. If you use the 4chan Firefox Extension, be sure to grab the latest
    version!</p>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Here is an update!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>To address some of the complaints I've been receiving: Yes we are working on
      fixing the extension! It seems like a lot of people skimmed over the v.0.4.4.4
      changelog which reads "-<em>Temporarily disabled inline image expansion</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>To those deriding us for "begging" users to unblock the ads: I don't believe
      we've <em>begged</em> for anything. It's been stated that unblocking the ads and
      supporting the sponsors directly benefits 4chan and in turn, the user. That's a
      fact. Unfortunately, the internet doesn't run on rainbows and candy canes. People
      seem to be forgetting that we haven't asked for a penny in over one year. Good
      vibes and happy thoughts aren't what is keeping this site alive&mdash;money is.</p>
      <p>Until 4chan achieves a steady flow of advertising revenue, we can't expand the site
      or add features. Stagnation is unacceptable to me and so is the dwindling quality
      of service that usually follows. For February we're planning some major backend
      changes that should restore the sites usability to where it was around a year ago.
      I hinted at this in my original posting but it would appear that people were so
      overcome with internet rage that they this missed this bit: "<em class=
      "c2">Thankfully, we're already hard at work upgrading our current infrastructure
      and internet connection. Providing we keep receiving continued support from the
      community, you can expect good things from us in the near future</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>Note that: [As per usual] not a single person has e-mailed me regarding these
      changes. Complaining on the imageboards will more likely get you banned than result
      in a change. I've already said all I can on the front page; as always
      questions/comments/concerns can be e-mailed to me at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finally: Despite what you may be thinking right now, it's really <em class=
      "c2">not that bad</em>. Remember that in order to deliver this website to the user
      free of charge, we <em>must</em> run advertising. Just because it's free for you
      doesn't mean it's free for us. I hope that most of the community will be able to
      move past their initial distaste for the active interstitial (as I have), and
      understand that merely the toleration of <em>a second</em> of advertising
      <em>once</em> per <em>day</em> is all that we are asking for... But maybe I'm just
      a hopeful guy!</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Updated at 3:20AM on 01/10/07.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>If you are seeing the interstitial ad more than once per
      day</em>: Make sure that your browser and/or firewall are accepting third party
      cookies. Be sure to whitelist AdBrite.com and 4chan.org! On some browsers, the
      default security settings block these cookies (ie. Safari), which causes the ad to
      display more than once.</p></li>
      <li><p>To those waiting on the extension update: I just finished beta-testing the new
      release. We've got a few minor kinks to work out, but it should be made available
      within the next 24-48 hours.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you've e-mailed me recently: I replied to most of the messages that I've
      received over the past 24 hours. <em>A lot</em> of them bounced though. If you're
      on Hotmail, or use the Spamhaus SBL, you probably didn't receive my response.
      Complain to your mail provider and Spamhaus about this! Spamhaus has a horrid
      reputation concerning their failure to remove illegitimate blocks. We've contacted
      them about it but they've yet to lift ours. If you plan on sending me e-mail, be
      sure to add me to your whitelist!</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>PS</strong>: Read the old news post if you haven't already. It's pretty
    informative!</p>

    <p>Over the
    past few months 4chan has become noticeably less responsive (read: <em>slower</em>).
    In the next few paragraphs I'm going to try to explain why this is happening, and how
    we're planning on fixing it. First, let's start off with a neat graph:</p>
    <p><span class="center"><a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chancc.png"><img src=
    "//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chancc.th.png" alt=
    "4chancc.th.png" style="width: 324px; height: 180px;" /></a><br />
    <small>Thanks to Mr VacBob for helping me chart this.</small></span></p>
    <p>Alexa Internet's traffic ranking statistics and our monthly hosting bill have been
    used to plot 4chan's usage (population) versus capacity (resources) over the past
    three years. You'll notice that, for the most part, both have scaled together
    accordingly, despite some minor bumps along the way. Recently, however, a growing
    disconnect has formed between the two. What does this mean? It's pretty simple: 4chan
    needs more "resources" to support its growing "population". For us, resources
    translates into <em>bandwidth</em>, and subsequently&mdash;<em>money</em>; which in 4chan's
    history, has been pretty hard to come by.</p>
    <p>Donations, merchandising, and premium services are out (for now at least). Donations
    are unreliable and frankly, unacceptable. Literally, we can't accept them. There
    isn't a single online payment gateway around that is willing to touch 4chan with a
    ten foot pole; we've checked! If you've investigated and found otherwise, feel free
    to e-mail me your findings. Moving on to merchandising; it's way too much of a time
    sink and initial investment to deal with right now. Merchandising is by <em>no
    means</em> a "quick fix" for monetary woes. While I believe that some day we'll offer
    physical goods, today is not that day. When we do merchandising, we're going to do it
    right, meaning: giving our users access to quality items at affordable prices,
    instead of using it as a last ditch attempt at making some dough. As for premium
    services, personally I'm not a fan of the idea. I'd like to maintain the status quo
    for as long as possible. So with <span class="s">donations</span>, <span class=
    "s">merchandise</span>, and <span class="s">premium services</span> all out of the
    question, we're on to our last option... advertising.</p>
    <p>You may have noticed that we do in fact, already run advertisements. Or maybe you
    haven't. We've always put a strong emphasis on preserving our so-called "user
    experience", to the point where we've shortchanged ourselves a number of times in
    terms of lucrative advertising deals so as to not detract from it. In our continued
    effort to offer this website to you free of charge, changes are going to be made.
    Soon, we're going to be introducing two new banner ads on the imageboards. A sample
    mockup can be viewed <span class="s">here</span>. The proposed
    placements are directly below the current 468x60 rotating banner ad, and at the
    bottom of the page, above the page switcher/deletion box/navigation bar. Through
    these ads, we're looking to generate an extra $200-$400 per month which will be used
    to purchase more bandwidth, and eventually, another server.</p>
    <p>With additional bandwidth capacity, 4chan should become apparently faster, as it was
    back in February. Things tend to get pretty slow when you're <a href=
    "//s.4cdn.org/image/news/traffic-nov30.png">maxing</a> out your connection 24/7,
    as we are now; something we're taking steps to avoid in the future. All it's going to
    take from the users to achieve this is the toleration and support of our new
    advertisers. We hope that this change will be warmly received, since the future of
    this website depends on it.</p>
    <p>Aside from the aforementioned, not much is new. We're hard at work improving the
    website from behind the scenes, and are currently preparing for a surprise site
    addition by Christmas. Look for an update on that in the coming weeks. As always, I

    <p><a href="http://www.otakon.com">Otakon</a> (August
    4 - 6, 2006 / Baltimore, MD) is now only <em>two weeks</em> away! That being said,
    I'd like to officially announce <em><strong>4chan: The Otakon 2006
    Panel</strong></em>. The panel will take place on <span><strong>Saturday,
    from 11:30PM until 12:30AM, and is open to all ages (PG-13).</strong></span></p>
    <p>A few quickies: You may remember last year's panel room was far too small to
    accommodate all those who showed up. This year, with the help of Lou Arruda, we've
    managed to secure "Panels 3", which seats approximately 680 people&mdash;almost triple the
    capacity from last year. As always, we'll have buttons on hand for distribution to
    those who attend the panel, and those who catch us walking around the convention. A
    bulk of the 4chan staff will be in attendance, so if you see a team member, be sure
    to greet them and demand a button. Panel goers will receive a special commemorative
    button with a design similar to last year's.</p>
    <p>More information will be released as it becomes available. Pay extra attention to the
    blotter and global message for updates. We hope to see you all there!</p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: COME TO OUR PANEL. If you browse and remotely enjoy this
    site I expect you to be in attendance. We're hard at work planning our 2006 encore,
    which should make it our best panel yet. Don't miss out! As per usual, any

    rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated." &mdash;Mark Twain</em></p>
    <p>Six months ago we parted ways with a proclaimation that "<em>Things are
    looking up</em>." Today I'm pleased to report that, to the best of my knowledge, this
    has been the case. Despite a lack of news updates (I've opted to use the DevBlog, <a href="/blotter?all">blotter</a>, and global message
    instead), we've gotten a lot accomplished over these past few months.</p>
    <p>Three issues took center stage during our last fundraiser: the purchase and
    subsequent colocation of new servers, and an expectation that the site begin making
    "progress" once more. So where do we stand? Well, the <a href=
    "//s.4cdn.org/image/news/dellwhat.jpg">servers</a> have been purchased and
    <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/record.png">colocated</a>; in addition we've
    taken many <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/progress.png">strides</a> in site
    development. Mission accomplished, I suppose.</p>
    <p>...Honestly I am at a loss for words right now so I'll end this here. It has been a
    while since I've had to write a proper news post, and it would seem that I've lost
    the touch. Check back next week or so for another update which should shed light on
    our future merchandising and fundraising ambitions. Until then&mdash;take care!</p>

    <p><em>One more thing</em>. A few staffers, including myself, will be in attendance at
    <a href="http://www.acen.org">Anime Central</a> this coming May. Currently no meet is
    planned; but we may throw something together at the last minute, so keep an eye out.
    As always I'll be carrying buttons, so if you see me, be sure to ask for one.</p>

    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3><p>I've put off writing this newspost for so long
    because I haven't been able to precisely articulate what I've wanted to say. I truly
    hope the following suffices.</p>
    <p>If you haven't already noticed, the site is still up and running. For the dense among
    us, this means that the site is <em>not yet dead!</em> Thank you to those who have
    contributed what they could to 4chan; as always, we appreciate any and all
    contributions made to the site. Without this most recent and especially generous
    outpouring of support, monetary and otherwise, the site would have been long gone by
    now. I'd like to extend my thanks, and that of the Team, to those who have taken it
    upon themselves to in essence, give back to the community.</p>
    <p>As for where we currently stand: <em>Things are looking up</em>. While we
    did not reach our stated goal, we <em>did</em> surpass all realistic expectations.
    It's hard to raise money&mdash;we realize this, which is why we chose to undertake such an
    ambitious donation drive in the first place. We are confident that with the amount of
    funds collected to date, the site will remain hosted (as it is currently) for at
    least another six months. Colocating our new servers still remains a priority, and we
    have been working hard to hammer out a new hosting deal to get our servers shipped
    out as soon as possible. Currently, we are in negotiations with a well-known company
    which has firm ties in the anime community, and I'm both confident and hopeful that
    something will be worked out within the next month or so.</p>
    <p>Looking towards the future, we have plenty of nifty (and hopefully anticipated)
    additions planned for you guys. Don't think that just because the front page is being
    updated less frequently that we have stagnated in development. The first of these
    planned additions, is the 4chan DevBlog. The
    4chan Blog will contain updates that do not warrant full blown newsposts or board
    notices. I intend to employ its use in keeping users informed of recent "behind the
    scenes" happenings, and apprised of new proposals, ideas, and plans. I also plan on
    using it to respond to the many criticisms which we receive pertaining to how the
    site is being run, and how it "should" be run. Our DevBlog has the potential to be a
    very powerful tool for those who would wish to challenge past decisions, and those
    who would like to have their voice heard and responded to outside of /sug/. I
    understand this may not be the most impressive of additions; however, I assure you,
    it is the first of many to come. Be sure to check up on the blog in the coming days
    for its inaugural update(s)!</p>
    <p>That should about wrap things up. If you feel that I've forgotten to include any
    pertinent issues in this update, try e-mailing me
    or posting about it on /sug/ (yes, I actually read /sug/, but recently it has yet to
    produce much of value). For those of you who managed to read through all of this, you
    have my thanks.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">IS THIS IT? by moot -
    9/15/05 @ 3:00AM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#80" id="80" title=
    "permalink">#</a></span></h3><p>Time for a redundant newspost. There are three
    <strong>major</strong> points to be made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Servers</strong>: I went ahead and <em>purchased</em> three new
      servers. They are Dell PowerEdge SC1425s with the following specifications: Dual
      3.0GHz Intel Xeon processors, 4GB DDR2 SDRAM, two 250GB SATA150 Seagate harddrives,
      with dual GigE ethernet connections. I'd like to reiterate what I said in the last
      newspost&mdash;that this migration should be likened to "night and day". In addition to
      running on enormously powerful hardware, we'd also have half a cabinet of
      rackspace, with a full 100mbps unmetered line at our disposal. The reason for all
      of these upgrades? Speed, stability, and much more room to expand. Like it or not,
      4chan <em>will</em> keep expanding. You guys are determining the rate of growth,
      not us.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Donations</strong>: <em>Donations have ceased.</em>
      To date, approximately 400 donations have been accepted, and while we appreciate
      and need every single one of them, we are still $9,000 short of what we <em class=
      "c2">need</em>. To make that clear: <strong>We need this money</strong>. Without
      it, we cannot afford to colocate the aforementioned servers, in effect, mooting
      their purpose. To complicate matters further, <span class="redb">we will no longer
      be accepting online donations after September 30th, approximately two weeks from
      now. This is the "last chance" to donate.</span> A snail mail address has been
      posted on the <span class="s">donation</span> page for those
      unable to donate online. Again, <strong>this is it</strong>.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Meeting</strong>: We have scheduled a rather last minute,
      <em>emergency</em> meeting, to be be held at <em>10:00PM EST, Thursday,
      September 15th (tonight)</em>. Drawing from our past experiences with these
      meetings, I have no doubt that this will play a critical role in determining the
      direction in which this site will follow. If you wish to submit questions,
      comments, complaints, etc., do so by popping onto IRC at the following: <a href=
      "irc://irc.rizon.net/4chan">#4chan @ Rizon IRC (irc.rizon.net)</a>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>On a lighter note, a few staff members will be attending <a href=
    "http://www.awa-con.com/">Anime Weekend Atlanta</a>, and with them they will bring
    some new goodies to hand out. An impromptu meet may or may not be arranged as well,
    so be sure to check the bulletin board during the con, or the front page a few days
    beforehand for more information. Also, I'd like to note that we will be hosting a
    panel this November at <a href="http://www.animeusa.org/">AnimeUSA</a>&mdash;be sure to
    check it out if you're in the area.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">LONGCAT AND BEYOND by moot - 8/30/05 @ 3:17AM EST</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#79" id="79" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3><span class="s"><img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/donatemeter.png" style="float: right; border: 0; width: 64; height: 400;" 
    alt="donatemeter.png" /></span><p>Time for an update.</p>
    <p>Currently we've received donations from 196 people, totaling almost $5000USD. While
    this is nothing to scoff at, you'd figure a site with ~50,000 users a day would have
    a bigger showing of support. What matters in the short term is that we have the next
    month covered, however, <em>we'd still like to raise the goal amount by
    the end of the week</em>. Some people seem to be a bit confused about what the goal
    of this "DONATE OR DIE 2005" week is all about. I'll try to sum it up in an English I
    hope most will understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Owned vs. leased</strong>: <strong>Leased servers are not cost
      effective</strong>. A sizeable portion of the donations are to be set aside for the
      <em>purchase</em> of new servers. Purchasing servers as opposed to leasing them
      allows us more flexibility in terms of available hardware and bandwidth, which
      translates into what we can or cannot do with the website. Again, what we have in
      mind for the server and bandwidth upgrade is akin to night and day. More details
      will be posted if and when we actually purchase these servers. The "if" part is
      dependent on whether or not we reach our goal. Read on...</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Now vs. later</strong>. The advantage of getting this over with now is
      the immediate satisfaction of site needs. Our current setup struggles to run the
      site as is, and the situation is not improving, as the site grows every day. Any
      competent webmaster (don't worry, I don't consider myself one) will tell you that
      donations cannot be relied upon for the long term running of a website, and I
      agree. As time progresses, it is harder for us to collect donations due to
      processing difficulties and general disinterest amongst users. The solution to
      bypassing these issues is to attempt to collect all of the money needed in one fell
      swoop&mdash;which is exactly what we are doing. With money issues done away with, the
      site would be smooth-sailing for at least one year.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Life after?</strong> What happens if we don't reach the target? Well
      I'd rather not ponder that, since as I've said before, we are committed to
      achieving our goal. However, in the event that we <em>do not</em>
      collect $20,000 in donations, the site will continue to run as long as is possible
      to do so. Yet again, I must stress that <strong>we would rather eliminate money
      issues entirely, by collecting all that is needed to sustain the site on new
      hardware and bandwidth for at least one year</strong>. Given this opportunity, we
      can come up with and give thought to new means of collecting money, such as the
      often suggested merchandising option.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>User input!</strong> As always, we value user input and try our best to
      accommodate as many users as humanly possible. For this reason, we are planning on
      hosting yet another meeting via IRC some time in the near future. Expect an update
      on this within the next few days. Meetings in the past have been <em class=
      "c2">vital</em> to the site's development, and I expect this meeting to be no
      different. We urge users to try their best to show up and be heard.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, that is it for now. I hope I've covered most of the many questions that have
    been asked over these past two days regarding "DONATE OR DIE 2005". If you look to
    the upper right, you'll see that we have added a new longcat donation meter. As more
    donations come in, longcat rises to infinity... In closing:</p>
    <p><span class="redb">Show your support, <span class="s">donate</span>. Check out <a href=
    "//s.4cdn.org/image/news/donatemeter.png">longcat</a> in the meantime as well.

    <p><em>4chan is dead</em>. Well no, not really, but it's pretty close! We have received
    a small amount of donations over the past year, however, it hasn't come close to
    offsetting our current costs of operation. Our last donation drive went from a
    complete success to a total failure after PayPal locked the donation account and
    seized the money. There is some good news though:</p>
    <p><span class="redb">You can donate to 4chan directly now, <span class="s">online</span>, using your credit or debit card. IT IS
    EASY, FAST, AND SECURE.</span></p>
    <p>Our goal is ambitious&mdash;we are trying to raise around $20,000 to cover the purchase of
    three new servers, to be colocated on a 100mbit line. This may seem a bit daunting,
    but read on to see what it gets you.</p>
    <p>First of all, how will this change things? Honestly, the servers we are interested in
    purchasing are five times more powerful than the stuff we are currently hosted on.
    Furthermore, we would have a full 100mbit (30TB/mo.) unmetered line at our disposal,
    as opposed to our currently strained 60mbit. Not only will the website be blazingly
    fast, it will be stable, and potentially larger. As always, we are dedicated to
    growing out the site further, and developing what we already have. Unfortunately,
    without some major cashflow, this isn't going to happen any time soon, <em>if at all</em>. 
    Did I mention that we would probably have enough to cover an entire year of hosting?</p>
    <p><em>Donating is easy as pie</em>. Since we are now signed up with a
    <em>real</em> credit card processor, we can take payments directly, as opposed to
    going through a middleman. The <span class="s">donation</span>
    page explains it all in more detail, but I <em>will</em> note that there is an option
    for PayPal users!</p>
    <p>So basically it comes down to this. Let the site die once more (a shame, especially
    after our one year of solid uptime), or pony up a bit of cash, and bail 4chan out.
    Running this website should not be putting me into debt, which it currently is. It is
    up to you, the users, to provide for the site now. Without further ado, I proclaim
    this week to be...</p>

    <p><span>Recently a news post was put up without
    knowledge or approval from the site owner, me. While a few points it touched on are
    truthful, the overwhelming gist, is not.</span></p>
    <p>4chan is in need of money, but then again, when isn't it? The site as of now has
    funds to remain up through the month of July, however, beyond that, it is a mystery.
    I am currently trying to accept donations and bring more advertisers on board to
    extend this date through the end of the year. We I can assure all of you, the users,
    that this time is no different. Running things down to the wire is commonplace for
    this site, and we are working hard to put an end to this.</p>
    <p>There will be an open call for donations and advertisers within the next few days. To
    stay alive for more longer this month, we will need a lot of support. The site is
    growing rapidly, and soon leasing will need to be replaced with a real collocation
    plan. This of course, costs a lot&mdash;upwards of $1000 a month. Think that is a lot?
    Yeah, but when you think about it, the site is gigantic and it really shouldn't be a
    problem. Then again, how many times have we said that by now...</p>
    <p>I'll be posting an update within the next forty-eight (48) hours. It will basically
    reiterate this post but add more details as to what our current situation is, what we
    are doing about it, and some cool new things we have planned for the site.</p>
    <p>To sum it up, <strong>4chan IS NOT DEAD, IT IS AS ALIVE AS IT WAS LAST WEEK (not
    very? durr hurr). THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CEASE OPERATIONS AS OF NOW. THE PRIOR UPDATE
    WAS MERELY AN UNINFORMED POST THAT HAD NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.</strong> I apologize for
    all of the trouble this may have caused.</p>
    <p>In closing, I'd like to add we will tentatively be holding a meeting on 
    <strong>Tuesday, July 5th, at 10:00PM EST.</strong> Check back within the
    next 48 hours for a new and more complete update. Don't miss this meeting, I assure

    <p>I'll try to make this as short and to the point as possible.</p>
    <p>We have purchased a new server which should be online within the next week or so.
    This brings 4chan's bandwidth capacity to a full 60mbps. We expect this to be maxed
    out within the coming months. When this occurs, we will yet again need more donations
    if you want the server to run at a "speedy, error free" pace. Otherwise, with the
    current revenue standings, we are good for at least a few months. There are no
    complete stats compiled at this time&mdash;this is due to our on and off admin, DJ Lucid,
    abandoning us sporadically. We will be bringing a new admin onboard to make the new
    server transition as smooth as possible. <em>Hopefully</em> he can get stats compiled
    as well.</p>
    <p>Otakon has confirmed us for a panel this summer. If you don't know what <a href=
    "http://www.otakon.com">Otakon</a> is, it's the largest anime/Japanese culture
    convention located on the east cost. <a href="http://www.anime-expo.org">Anime
    Expo</a> has not been confirmed at this time, but it <em>is</em> a possibility.
    <a href="http://www.animeusa.org">Anime USA</a> has actually invited us to return for
    a second year, so rest assured we will have a presence there as well, thanks to
    <span class="s">Man of Wax</span>. We will be releasing further details as the panels
    near.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we would like to announce that we have a new board in the works which is long
    awaited for many users&mdash;look for it soon! In addition, /gif/ and /hr/ will return
    once the new server is online.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">DING DONG IMPORTANT by moot - 2/26/05 @ 5:30AM EST</span><span class=
    "permalink"> <a href="?all#73" id="73" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>We wrapped up our meeting a few hours ago and in my opinion it was an overall
    success. Over five hundred users joined us on IRC to listen, provide feedback, and
    ask questions. Here are a few things we discussed during the meeting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Boards</strong>. Three new trial boards have been added. They are
      <a href="//boards.4chan.org/gif/">/gif/ - Animated GIF</a>, <a href=
      "//boards.4chan.org/hr/">/hr/ - High Resolution</a>, <a href=
      "//boards.4chan.org/wg/">/wg/ - Wallpapers/General</a>. In addition,
      all but one previous trial board will be taken off of probationary status. "/x/ -
      General Photo" has been removed.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Money</strong>. 4chan still requires money to operate&mdash;lots of it. Costs
      have risen and we will need $600 a month from here on out, which sets the goal at
      $7200. This is extremely attainable and I will share why. During the week leading
      up to its fourth death, 4chan received about 70,000 unique IP hits. For all intents
      and purposes, we will make "unique IP hits" synonymous to "users". This past week,
      4chan has received over 170,000<sup>*</sup> user hits. For argument's sake, these
      are people&mdash;people who use the site and have the ability to donate. Do the math and
      it's a bit less than five cents per person. Unfortunately, these past months we
      have had trouble getting ten people to donate, much less 170,000!</p>
      <p>Donating and also taking out ads ensures that this site stays alive. While 4chan
      currently is and will always remain a free service, we are not the Salvation Army.
      It is not feasible to run a site into debt in every incarnation because users will
      not <em>help out</em> and "pony up". We have kept good on our word these past five
      months and have improved and expanded the site immensely, and now we feel that it
      is your time to help out.</p>
      <p><em>Donations are being accepted through the usual means. <span class=
      "s">Man of Wax</span> can accept money orders and personal checks via snail mail.
      To learn more about donating this way, email him <span class=
      "s">here</span>.</em></p>
      <p>Note: We will be posting full site statistics within the next few days as well as
      donation drive progress.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>. Like all of our past meetings, we held an open
      Q&amp;A session. We will have logs available shortly.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's about it. In closing I'd just like to thank of all those who attended and
    made the meeting a success. We appreciate your stopping by and hope to see such
    support in the continued future. Remember: Donating is the only thing that will keep
    this site alive in the coming months. If you care about what you see&mdash;DONATE!</p>
    <p><sup>*</sup>This statistic is inaccurate. The complete logs have not been fully
    processed, and we expect this number to be <em>higher</em>!</p>

    <p>We will be conducting a <em>very</em> important meeting via IRC on Friday, February 25th, at
    approximately 10:30PM EST (GMT -5). It is both requested and suggested that as many
    users attend as possible. In the past we have hosted two similar IRC discussions on
    rather short notice and without ample planning, however, this next meeting has been
    mapped out and has a tentative agenda place. <em>Don't miss it</em>.</p>
    <p>As we have done in the past, there will be an open Q&amp;A session for users to
    ask questions, give feedback, and respond to answers. In the past these have been
    VERY successful and many of the recent changes you see today have come about through
    them. We ask that you <strong>please submit questions beforehand</strong> using
    <span>this</span> web interface so that we may have formatted questions
    available before the meeting starts, as opposed to taking the majority of them
    during. Hopefully this will speed things up a bit and allow us to respond more. Thank

    <p>After a festive evening's conversation in the 4chan IRC channel we're ready to
    make certain changes, leave other things the way they are and also reemphasize a few
    points. Moot fielded a bunch of questions tonight and we are working on improving
    4chan based on your uniformly excellent* points.</p>
    <p>New boards are being added as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="//boards.4chan.org/e/">/e/ - Ecchi</a>. This is not /c/
      or /h/. It is for images too risque for /c/ but not explicit enough for /h/. I
      think we'll all figure this one out. Loli is not permitted.</li>
      <li><span class="s">/3/ - 3DCG</span>. An image board for 3D model renderings
      only.</li>
      <li><a href="//boards.4chan.org/g/">/g/ - Gur- I mean,
      Technology</a>. An image board for gadgetry and geekdom. Worksafe.</li>
      <li><span class="s">/n/ - Nature &amp; Wildlife</span>. Animals, trees, insects,
      etc. Photos and art are both acceptable. This is a worksafe board; no furries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As in every case where a new board is added, it is up to you, the users, to make
    it worthwhile. If a board has low activity it will be removed. We believe there is
    sufficient interest to make these boards viable, so prove us right. In the next few
    weeks we will keep on evaluating and adding/removing trial boards in an effort to
    keep new content flowing, and branch 4chan out even more. Thank you in advance for
    the support.</p>
    <p>Remember, and I cannot stress this enough, 4chan is what you make it.</p>

    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>I'd like to quickly detail our experience with
    YowCow. To make a long story short, our account was suspended weeks back for
    absolutely no reason. It took about three weeks, and over four emails to get them to
    respond. The reply I received was poorly written and could be summed up with "Oops
    our email is being funny, but hey your account was closed months ago! LOL". It was
    obvious that nobody had bothered to check the site for a second time, nor was the
    company interested in providing any explanation for their actions. As such, I would
    consider YowCow to be a poorly instituted payment alternative which makes up with a
    complete lack of professionalism where PayPal falls behind in customer service. But
    hey, at least I received a poorly written and evasive email instead of the generic
    babble I have come to expect these days!</p>
    <p>YowCow should be refusing payments to the account by now, in addition any prior
    donations WILL NOT BE CHARGED. If you sent a donation, you will not be charged for it
    since YowCow requires the buyer send positive feedback to them before turning payment
    over to the seller. If your funds seem to be frozen by YowCow (which would not
    surprise me), I would suggest you get started in complaining to them, because if my
    correspondence is any indication of a timely and articulate response, you will have a
    long road ahead of you. I apologize for picking YowCow as a means for accepting
    donations&mdash;at the time there was no indication that they were any worse than PayPal,
    and that of course seemed to be a very good thing.</p>
    <p>As for donations and such, I do not have an exact figure as of now. <span class=
    "s">Man of Wax</span> should have one in the following days, however it is certain
    that it is nowhere near the set goal. I would guess that with debt incurred from the
    previous months of operation deducted from the total raised, enough money for one to
    two months was acquired. Thank you to those who donated and purchased ads, without
    that support 4chan would have been dead by now.</p>
    <p>If anyone is interested, <span class="s">Man of Wax</span> can be contacted for other
    means of sending in donations.</p>

    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>As you've no doubt noticed, there have been some
    pretty significant changes to 4chan today. Some of you are understandably wondering
    what we're doing and why.</p>
    <p>The fact is, and we really are sorry about it, but we have zero money.
    <strong>ZERO</strong>. Back when we started up (again) we made some good returns on
    ads and donations and we've been trying to hold ourselves together on that. Of
    course, for a site the size of 4chan that's impossible. I just want to give you a
    sense of the scale of things to appreciate what it is that we do here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>4chan pushes roughly 6.3TB of data/month. That is almost double what we we did
      in the previous incarnation of 4chan, and this number will double again come
      December.</p></li>
      <li><p>On an off-day the site gets over 32,000 unique hits from users all over the
      world (we're talking Finland, Singapore, Italy, and a host of others here
      people).</p></li>
      <li><p>4chan was originally run by one person: moot. We now have more than twenty
      moderators working to ensure that we have a great site and, more
      importantly, internet community. We want more than anything for you to have a
      positive experience. There are copycat image boards out there, but none of them
      have the size and quality of staff needed to run a site of 4chan's size.</p></li>
      <li><p>Running 4chan for a full year will cost roughly
      <strong>$7,200</strong>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is it folks. On past occasions when 4chan was in dire straits such as these
    the community has stood up and made it possible. It may seem like we do this a lot,
    like we're always begging and never getting anywhere. Even so, 4chan recently had its
    first anniversary. It has been a bumpy ride, no doubt about it, but we've got
    staying-power. We're still with you and we need you to still be with us.</p>
    <p><span class="s">We're back on board with YowCow. It's easy to set up and it's not
    PayPal so there's no need to worry about their baggage. Just click the button and
    donate a little something (or a lot something). This an easy and completely painless
    way to ensure that we continue to bring you the 4chan experience.</span> Be sure to
    support our advertising sponsors as well.</p>
    <p>Speaking of advertising, send an email to <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span> for info on how you can
    advertise pretty much anything on 4chan&mdash;one of the largest anime interest websites in
    the world. Our rates are criminally low for a site 4chan's size and popularity and we
    have flexible payment options. Both personal and business ads are welcome. If you
    want to capture the anime market there is no better site on which to advertise.</p>
    <p>I'm going to say it again. The site needs money or it goes bye-bye and don't count on
    a v.6. There's more incentive though. 4chan is not going to stagnate. We have plans
    to make the site more full-featured, to improve posting quality and the image of both
    our board and its users. What are we going to do? We'll add things like reviews (both
    serious and non), new (and resurrected) boards, more pages per board, and a better
    portal with new and interesting content.</p>
    <p><em>Remember, we are the original English chan and there is no substitute.
    We want to run an awesome website that we can all be proud of, but 4chan doesn't come
    cheaply.</em></p>
    <p>As otaku always emphasizes, every donation counts. Even a few bucks goes a long way
    to keeping the site alive. With 32,000 users you'd think scraping up donations would
    be easy... Unfortunately it's not.</p>

    <p>Oh, hello. There's been a bunch of changes over
    the past few days, and now the majority of them are done. I felt it was finally time
    to update about them.</p>
    <p>There have been a few board additions, as well as one "subtraction."</p>
    <ul>
      <li>+ <span class="s">/ib/ - Oekaki Random</span></li>
      <li>+ <span class="s">/ip/ - Oekaki Pro</span></li>
      <li>+ <a href="//boards.4chan.org/v/">/v/ - Video Games</a></li>
      <li>+ <span class="s">/tech/ - Technology</span></li>
      <li>- /n/ - Trains<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Train lovers, don't fret. /n/ was removed due to not having enough posts, but I
    know there are still people out there who liked /n/. Posting of trains is now
    permitted in /o/, but don't take over the place, okay? 
    The HTML and image files in /n/ will stay up for a little bit, for anyone who wants
    to archive them.</p>
    <p>Please make sure to read the rules for the new boards, and also check them regularly,
    as new ones could be added soon.</p>
    <p>As well as the new discussion board of /tech/ being added, all the data from the old
    dis boards is back, along with an updated version of the board software.</p>

    <p>So, 4chan has been up and running for nearly two months
    now. Everyone has gotten settled in, habits have formed, and posting has... well,
    posting has almost died off.</p>
    <p>Board contributions are way, way down at the moment. A few of the newer boards, such
    as /sm/ and /n/, are severely lacking in fresh material. This is a large
    disappointment because these boards were soley added because the users of 4chan
    requested it, not because any one person felt so. If we feel that they aren't being
    used, then we'll remove them&mdash;4chan doesn't have space or bandwidth to waste, as you
    all know. Posting needs to <em>pick up</em>, and <em>stay up</em>, if you want to
    retain your favourite boards. We've been picking up new and unique users at a
    ridiculous rate and, when you consider that user-base, 10 image posts per day on some
    of the boards is <em>utterly pathetic</em>. Help turn 4chan around&mdash;all it
    takes is five minutes and you've contributed to the continuation of one of the
    boards.</p>
    <p>The other issue is the new crackdown on trolls. The Team, myself included, apologise
    for the way things have been; the problem is being addressed but we're going to need
    help, <strong>i.e. Users need to stop breaking the rules on purpose. Stop trolling outside
    of /b/ unless the comment is WITTY and HILARIOUS (note: 99% of them are not), and
    start contributing more.</strong></p>
    <p>We are now making an active effort to remove the trolls from our community by
    enforcing the new rules, thus making 4chan a happier and friendlier place to visit.
    We're not asking for one big circle of love, singing, dancing, empty smiles of love
    and warmth&mdash;just a bit of <em>respect</em> and <em>restraint</em>. Part of what 
    makes 4chan a fun place to visit is the fact that the rules are not rigidly enforced, 
    however it has come to the point where users have 
    stopped using common sense and instead of adding to the site, they start detracting
    from it.</p>
    <p>The site is getting ever more popular, but we still need you to get the word out: the
    more the users, the more the content; the more the content, the better the site and
    thus the better the community. You've heard it all before. <em>Quality users who
    contribute quality posts make a quality community</em>. Don't let a few bad apples
    ruin it for everyone.</p>
    <p>So, the latest message from the 4chan Team in a nutshell:</p>
    <p><span class="redb">Stop trolling and get contributing.</span></p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: DamageInc coded a really neat Firefox extension for 4chan.
    Check it out <span class="s">here</span>. More nifty features to come in the future.</p>

    5:00PM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#59" id="59" title=
    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
	<p>There are several changes that warrant mention so let's start with the biggest
    one. We've added three new boards</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>/k/ - Weapons</strong> - For the posting and admiration of various
      killing instruments. Guns, knives, planks with nails in them, and so on. Note:
      Military machinery and related is allowed.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>/o/ - Auto</strong> - For things that go fast and look good doing it.
      Civic owners only, please. If you have friends who are into cars but don't post on
      4chan now is the time to convert them and get the word out.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>/sm/ - Shota/Male</strong> - If this board interests you, you already
      know what it is. Think of it as /y/'s own /l/ board. As always, ANY real pictures
      will not be tolerated.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next up is a disturbing trend in usage. Despite a huge increase in browsing we are
    seeing a sharp decline in posts. While it's nice to see so many people enjoying the
    content, we'd like to encourage more contribution. Posting is not only a sign of
    appreciation for 4chan and your fellow users, but it also keeps the boards lively. If
    a board is found to be mainly inactive we will delete it. Each of the three new
    boards needs your support to stay in commission. A few others (/cm/ for example) are
    in danger of losing their 4chan seal of approval for lack of content. If you like
    your board, contribute to it.</p>
    <p>Lastly, /b/ while not lacking in contribution is lacking highly in quality. It
    went from being unique and hilarious to, "Hey guys, let's spam shock-site
    pictures!!", and is getting pretty "old". I understand that it's as moderated as a
    stall in a road-stop somewhere in Ogallala, but it would be nice if the content were
    a little better. Then again, that is only my personal opinion on the matter. Make
    your parents proud.</p>

    <p>So far, 4chan has been struggling a bit to keep its head
    above water, but it doesn't have to be that way. 4chan now has three ways to earn
    much needed revenue and you can help us in every case.</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>We have <a href="/advertise">banner ads</a> running. Our prices are extremely low
     and whether you want to sell a product, generate more traffic for your site or just
     poke fun at your buddies with a banner viewed by hundreds of thousands of people this
     is the way to go. Send an email to advertise@4chan.org for more information.</p></li>
     <li><p><span class="s">We now have donations set up through Yahoo's PayDirect service.
     We've finally found a company whose terms we don't violate and that means that
     everyone who's chomping at the bit to donate can now do so. You will need to register
     an account at paydirect.yahoo.com. To ensure a smoother donation process we ask that
     you email <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span> for information before you donate. Please tell us how 
     much you intend to donate and any questions that you may have. In turn we will
     provide you with other info needed to complete the donation process.</span></p></li>

    <p>Restarting a website the size of 4chan is a monumental task. Already, we are
    experiencing twice the traffic that we had when the original 4chan was at its peak.
    So, until our advertising begins to come through 4chan needs you guys to help out.
    <span class="s">You can do that by visiting our sponsors or you can also donate to
    4chan through the YowCow online transaction service. It's like PayPal only with less
    baggage. We don't enjoy asking you for money, but we need anything we can get so that
    in the future 4chan can really take off.</span></p>
    <p><span class="s">As little as $2 can go a long way toward feeding our hungry servers.
    </span></p>
    <p><strong>mootnote</strong>: As of 8/22/04 we won't be accepting donations via YowCow
    due to a violation of their AUP (thanks for reporting us!). Nobody donated anyway, so

    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p><span class="redb">ATTENTION: MOOT DID NOT WRITE THIS.
    SERIOUSLY.</span></p>
    <p>Everyone thought it wouldn't happen, but hey look who's back. 4chan has gathered up
    enough money, support, and a new team to make its fifth and hopefully last
    reincarnation possible.</p>
    <p>By choosing the a team of superlative coders, knowledgeable system administrators
    (NOT MOOT), and webmasters, we are now working on making 4chan bigger and better than
    it ever was before. We have learned from our mistakes made in the last few months,
    and are committed to reviving what 4chan once was&mdash;in the days before trouble and
    dissent arose.</p>
    <p>What we are going to try and do this time, is create a more open website for our
    visitors, where people like you can actually decide on a number of things that will
    shape the way the new 4chan website will work. 5chan refugees will be happy to hear
    that 4chan will try to keep a cleaner environment, but still allow a free form of
    discussion about virtually anything. It'll be like the old 4chan, just without all
    the crap that made you hate it.</p>
    <p>The new 4chan will be bigger and better; and we're going to take 2chan this time for
    sure. If you're wondering just how we're going to do it: Simple: by combining the
    efforts of the *chan sites, and taking the best of them all, we will basically create
    the number one site for image sharing and discussion.</p>
    <p>Please bear with us while the site comes back online. The ETA to having the site back
    to the way it was over a month ago is about one week. Image boards should be up
    within the next 48 hours, as well as e-mail and an interim discussion board. As
    always feel free to get on IRC at the old hangout: <span class="s">#4chan @
    irc.pyoko.org</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: The original is back, get the word out!<br />
    <strong>mootnote</strong>: Rumor is that I am no longer part of the team. Do not
    fear! For I am still the team leader/site owner or whatever you want to call it. I'm
    sure some people will be happy and some will be sad, however I am actually making an
    effort (THIS IS NEW!!) to appease both sides. Just bear with us for the first month
    and then pass judgement. Also, most of this newspost isn't my writing, but that
    should have been easy to tell because it is too happy and optimistic to be me ;_;.</p>

      <small>The above is an artist's representation of the following.</small>
    </span>
    <p>Well I guess this is the end for the last time. 4chan is now meeting its fourth and
    hopefully last death. In my opinion, the site was killed by the following
    things:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A lack of contribution outright, with asshole and poor quality posters mixed 
     in.</li>
     <li>Insufficient number servers and enough bandwidth to run the site smoothly, coupled 
     with a lack of a knowledgeable sysadmin.</li>
     <li>Disinterest from the "community" in seeing the site grow and prosper.</li>
     <li>Unwillingness to donate. Hey guys, when a server is using more bandwidth, things 
     cost a lot more! PS: I never went to Mexico, Happy April Fools!</li>
     <li>Flooding. GNAA put the final nail in the coffin, however I am thankful that they 
     willingly ceased the flood after finding out it was costing me money.</li>
     <li>Last but not least, me, a person sick of running this "monetary black hole" which 
     has ceased to be both fun to run, and never was rewarding to start with.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now I'll list a few things that I really needed help with but nobody from the
    community ever was willing to help out on. Help and donations have and I guess will
    <em>always</em> be sparse.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A talented PHP coder willing to further develop and streamline the Futallaby
     code.</li>
     <li>A highly experienced sysadmin that would assure the site had no downtime and was 
     running smoothly (DJ Lucid committed suicide I hear).</li>
     <li>Moderators that were unbias and competent. I never really gave the average user a 
     chance, but then again I had originally intended this to be RH only.</li>
     <li>Advertisers and sponsors willing to support the site without insane demands.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There's not much left to say. I spoke for a few hours on IRC answering questions and
    giving insight on my train of thought to the users present. 4chan just ceased being
    fun for me and began to be an overwhelming chore to run. I have a knack of easily
    "burning bridges" and angering the people that I ask for help. The site was really
    too demanding in its current incarnation for both me and those who have helped me.
    The GNAA flood was only the beginning of the end, and I had entertained the idea of
    shutting the site down with some moderators for a while. Now seems like the time to
    pull the plug, on a semi-good note before all goes to hell again, and inrecoverably
    so.</p>
    <p>I'd like to thank a few people out for helping me run the site. CV was a great
    stress reliever by taking e-mails for me, listening to the users suggestions, and
    writing news posts for me. shut has always been there to listen to me whine and beg
    for computer help. Souldark is Scottish and made me laugh with his funny accent.
    LordVorbis because he made fun of Souldark and his accent which again, made me laugh.
    thatdog for creating Futallaby, yet dropping all support for it in a fit (BURNING
    BRIDGES!). Shii for getting a semi-translated and working yet buggy version of 0ch
    PHP to me. otaku for being hilariously convinced he was up to the task of running the
    site, and also helping me deal with problems along the way. hova because he called me
    a fag, when he found out I did not mention him originally. Last but not least, the
    good, ruley, portion of the community who made the site what it was. I'm sure I've
    missed quite a few people but that's about all I can think of off the top of my
    head.</p>
    <p>If anyone wants to flirt with the idea of reviving the site for its fifth time, feel
    free to e-mail me at my usual address (hint: check my name above). Be prepared to
    send a resume or long list of reasons explaining why you are a worth while and
    commited person to work with. That's a polite way of saying, if you're a moron, don't
    bother me as it is wasting both of our time.</p>
    <p>It was a good run. Best of luck to all of the people who made it possible. Thanks for
    riding the rollercoaster known as 4chan. Oh and feel free to join everyone on IRC,
    <span class="s">#4chan on irc.pyoko.org.</span></p>

    IS WHAT YOU GET!</p>

    <p>And now a few words from shut:</p>
    <p>4chan originally started as a subproject to entertain all the nerds in ADTRW as an
    English version of 2chan. The original site eventually got out to the rest of the
    internet, and that is when the trouble began. Japanese flooders used up monthly
    bandwidth in days, assholes and morally righteous idiots came to troll in droves,
    GoDaddy axed the .net domain while PayPal cancelled the donation account, and most
    notably, our own apathy, all contributed to the long demise of 4chan.</p>
    <p>4chan started dying, in all senses, one week after the domain was registered. People
    came out to help, but never enough (CV, the moderators, thatdog (maintainer of the
    English Futabally), countless donations) to make the site seem more than a giant
    money sucking tumor. The most recent flooding just assured us that 4chan was past its
    prime in terms of entertainment value. I would personally like to thank the rest of
    the internet for completely sucking at everything that is not distributing
    pornography or hilarious email chain letters. You people should be ashamed of
    yourself.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting 4chan!</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">THE SITUATION by moot -
    5/09/04 @ 4:30PM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#52" id="52" title=
    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>CV has suggested that I be both contrite and blunt while
    writing this. I will do my best.</p>
    <p>4chan does not have enough money to run again. But wait, I asked for money two months
    ago and said we were fine! Well, we <em>were</em> fine. The two new problems are
    overall bandwidth consumption, and server load. I'll split these up to make it easier
    to understand:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>The maximum bandwidth throughput I can allow myself, so as to not 
     go over my allowed monthly limit, is 500GB a week. These past weeks we have been 
     doing about 600GB. What does this mean? Well multiply 100GB x 4, and you will get 
     400. Now if you divide that by .5 ($0.50/per 1GB over), you get 200, which translates 
     into $200. The server is normally extremely cheap, at $200 a month (flat without 
     overage). This month the fee will be $400. It's going to get increasingly hard (read: 
     not possible) to pay these new bills unless money is raised.</p></li>
     <li><p>Secondly, people may have noticed the site can be extremely slow 
     on weekdays (ironically weekdays are peak load times). This is due to the fact that 
     the server is quite literally "maxing out the line". This means that under normal 
     usage, the server is transferring around 9-10mbps. In addition to this, the maximum 
     amount of connections to the webserver Apache allows can be simultaneously reached, 
     resulting in excessively long page load times, and an apparent "lag" in page 
     requests.</p></li>
	</ol>
    <p>What are the viable solutions? Well for one thing, lowering filesizes. The faster a
    user can download a file, the faster that connection is "released" which allows for
    someone else to make a new request. The problem here is that every code the site runs
    is about as optimized as it is going to get. The second and most reasonable solution
    is to purchase a new server. The problem here is that there is not enough money to
    afford a second server while at the same time sustaining the current one.</p>
    <p>So if you've read this far, it should be pretty clear by now that something needs to
    be done. Thus, 4chan is going to have a second donation drive. Just like the one
    before, it is going to be an all or nothing approach. If we can't hit the quota
    <strong>($2,400USD)</strong>, the site will obviously die a slow, horrible, hilarious
    death. However if we can raise enough money I have a few things I can promise.</p>
    <p>For one thing, new boards will be added, both image and discussion. Like drawing? I'm
    sure some of 4chan's artsy users would enjoy a PaintBBS or "oekaki". Board lengths
    could be increased and if money allows, and I'll even consider hiring someone to add
    features on to futabally to make it faster. Overall, the site should run much faster
    and have much more room to grow. The amount of traffic of the site recieves growing
    at a quick rate, however posting is not. Don't let it fool you though, 4chan is
    getting bigger by the month and if played correctly, could become a much better
    site.</p>
    <p>That aside I'm specifically going to address one thing, and that is trolling. If the
    majority of your posts are baseless, uncalled for trolls (outside of /b/) you may
    have you post deleted and face the possibility of recieving a ban. As time progresses
    the community is getting both harsher and more absent minded. <em>As I
    said in the rules: asshole posters, stupid replies, and spam do not make a good site.
    I'm hoping most users will agree with me and attempt to make the future of the site a
    better one. I do sincerely apologize for the frequent donation pleas and site
    problems. Some things are beyond my control, ability, and amount of free
    time.</em></p>
    <p>Anticipating that I will not recieve enough donations, I am temporarily reinstating
    banners. See the <a href="/advertise">advertisement</a> page for
    more detailed info. That said...</p>
    <p><strong>IT BEGINS. AGAIN.</strong></p>
    <p>As always my PayPal is <span class="s"><em>paypal@4chan.org</em></span>. 
    <strong>Please comment on this newspost in /sug/, <span class=
    "s">here</span>.</strong> Just like otaku said last time, everything helps. Be it a
    few dollars or a few hundred dollars (unlikely!), every contribution will benefit the

    5/02/04 @ 6:50PM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#51" id="51" title=
    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>I have a few things on my mind that need
    addressing:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><strong>Rule breaking</strong>. A lot of people do not take the time to read the 
     rules. I haven't been banning people for the past few months but now that's changing. 
     Break the rules and either get your post deleted or get banned. Think I'm being an 
     asshole? Well if you're on the recieving end, it's your own fault for not taking the 
     five minutes required to familiarize yourself with the rules. I'm usually very 
     lenient when it comes to rule interpretation in the first place.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Board creation/deletion</strong>. Before asking for a board, consider if 
     there is enough support for one. 4chan seems to have hit it's maximum threshhold for 
     boards. Users may have noticed the site being slow to very slow recently, this is 
     because the current line is maxed out and the server load is high again. I really 
     need to distribute them over multiple servers, but again, can't afford that. Because 
     of this, any new board I add had better seem "worth it", meaning that they get a 
     decent ammount of contribution and traffic. See the next topic for more on 
     that.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Contribution</strong>. I'm getting to be quite disapointed with the 
     ammount of contribution the boards recieve. 4chan recieves an incredible ammount of 
     hits from tons of hosts, spread out among the boards. Unfortunately it seems /h/, the 
     board using the most bandwidth, pales in comparison when comparing the number of 
     posts it gets to those of /b/. The site is becoming a hoard of leeches. I am now 
     considering getting rid of boards such as /f/, /u/, and even /l/. Don't want to see 
     the board you frequent disappear? Contribute, be it replying or especially uploading 
     (this does not mean flood boards with shitty pictures or spam replies). Things had 
     better change, please get the word out.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Discussion boards</strong>. There are now three discussion boards up. 
     People who like to complain or have ideas should especially look at /sug/, because I 
     actually read it and have already changed parts of the site due to input. As stated 
     above, if these boards recieve a miniscule ammount of traffic, I will not consider 
     hosting them "worth it" and they will be removed.</p></li>

    <p>That's about it. I've created a thread on /sug/ for discussing this news post, so go

    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>All users should take two minutes of their time right
    now and read the rules. It is required that you understand the rules and abide by
    them when using the 4chan image boards. This goes for the disclaimer as well. Three
    things need specific addressing:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>/d/ is not a replacement for the old "/g/ - Guro" image board. Posting of guro 
     (scat, mutilation, snuff, etc.) will result in a ban. No warnings, no appeals.</p></li>
     <li><p>/p/ is not a new pseudo /b/. Stop posting catchphrases, stupid (read: useless, not 
     on subject) replies, and photoshops. It's meant for interesting photographs of all 
     sorts of things. I'm by no means trying to discourage discussion however as of late 
     it is becoming infested with /b/-esque images and conversation.</p></li>
     <li><p>/s/ is to have no underage pictures posted. Period. Even if it's an under-18 
     model, DO NOT POST IT. Why? It invites misinterpretation and the "wrong crowd". Go 
     elsewhere if you want those types of pictures.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The /g/ board may be put back up in the future, but I'm making no promises. Many
    users have noticed the site can be pretty slow these days, this is because as the
    site gets more and more popular, it eats up all of the bandwidth (mbps) I am paying
    for.</p>
    <p>A discussion board is also something I have wanted to put up for a while, but have
    not found a suitable script for. In my opinion, 0ch is the shittiest Perl script
    known to man (in my limited experience), and thus under no circumstances will I use
    it again. Please suggest to me a board that is not a vBulliten clone, simple,
    functional, and with no registration.</p>

    <p>I am tired so I will make this blunt.</p>
    <p>Thank you to all those who donated. The site now has enough money to run into 2005. I

    <p><strong>AN ACTUAL IMPORTANT NEWS POST! READ IT.</strong></p>
    <p>This is probably the last news post I'll need to make. Even with my advertising
    attempt and CV's request for donations, I haven't been able to garner enough to pay
    the March bill (at least February got paid). CV has advised me that there is some
    point at which I must let go, and this is it. This site simply does not support
    itself, it's a sad fact, but it's the truth. Even with the tons of users (most of the
    leechers who don't even post), we haven't had enough people pony up enough to pay two
    damn bills. March will will be the last month that I use out of pocket funds to pay
    the bill. Starting this March, if there is not enough money to pay the server bill,
    it will go unpaid and the server will be abandoned. This is the reality of the matter
    and it's taken me way too long to realize it. We have remained optimistic throughout
    the acquisition of server #3, but now that optimism is gone.</p>
    <p>Thank you to the posters and many thanks to the donators. I hope that the site goes
    on until the end of this year, but it's out of my hands starting now. I've said it
    many times before, but rest assured this will be the last time I "beg for
    money".</p>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: otaku told me to <span>emphasize</span> that every
    donation helps. Tons of people donating a tiny bit is better than having nobody
    donate!</p>

    <p>In some e-mails I've recieved it's been mentioned
    that many site viewers would like to know what the fund raising goal for 4chan is. To
    that end, moot figured out what it'll cost to keep the site running for the rest of
    the year: $2,200. That's the point where moot will stop begging for money <em>for the
    rest of the year</em>. Not small change though and we're not expecting everyone to
    start pitching in large sums of money (though donations are still appreciated, and
    February's bill is yet to be paid). Instead, we've decided to compromise on site
    advertising. That means we'll soon be rotating banner ads on the site. Anyone can buy
    a banner, the rules are <a href="/advertise">here</a>. We hope
    that banner ads will eventually be enough to keep the site running on its own.
    Comment on these rules in the <span class="s">BBS</span>, feedback is appreciated.
    Affiliate programs have also been added.</p>
    <p>Additionally, links are being changed to reflect 4chan.org. When and if we manage
    to get 4chan.net back, the links will be changed back, but until then there shouldn't
    be a need to edit your hosts file to view the site. 4chan.org email addresses should
    be working already.</p>

    <p>The tracker may go up within the next few weeks,
    but expect it to be much smaller than before, with about a maximum of 40 torrents.
    Server load is still pretty high at times, but bandwidth usage is down with the
    blocks and smaller image boards.</p>
    <p>Thanks to all the people that have donated, <em>everything</em> helps. I
    still don't have enough for the next payments, so if you have absolutely anything to
    spare and enjoy this site, please help out. Since I don't believe a lot of people
    regularly check the front page, I've added the donation button to all of the image
    boards, and may put up a small 88x31 transparent AnimeNation banner in the future if
    donations don't cut it.</p>
    <p>Looking towards the future I'd like to get the tracker back up, a couple discussion
    boards added (using 0ch, I still haven't succeeded in setting it up, if you can help
    please e-mail me), and the archive working. The archive would be a backlog of posts
    from all of the image boards. Basically, the public image boards would allow new
    content to be posted and replies to be added, but it would be limited to around 10-15
    pages in length. After that cutoff, the posts would be moved over to the board's
    archive which would disallow new content and replying, but be approximately 40-50
    pages in length. This would help me cut down on bandwidth and server load
    (considering I estimate a lot less people actually willing to donate to access them),
    and help me pay the bills and maybe even get another server in the future.</p>

    <p>The 4chan tracker was taken down to curb

    <p>Moot wanted me to post something to the news, but he

    I can only try and talk moot into bringing it back.</p>
    <p>Before anyone gets the idea that spamming illegal content on the other boards is a good way

    <p>The site has been running nicely, with absolutely
    no downtime for over a week. I'd just like to address some issues that have sprung up
    over the past few weeks:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>The rules have been changed slightly, specifically /h/ and /l/. Read them <a href= 
     "/rules">here</a> if you have not. I am now enforcing a zero 
     tolerance policy towards rule breaking&mdash;if you break a rule you will be banned from 
     either the image board that you broke a rule on, or in some cases all of them.</p></li>
     <li><p>A BitTorrent tracker is now 
     active at <span class="s">tracker.4chan.org</span>. Note that leechers who do not 
     upload will be promptly banned, do not cap your uploads or close torrents immediately 
     upon completion! I recommend Azureus and SHADOW for clients.</p></li>
     <li><p>Japanese (.jp) domains may be blocked in the future. This is because 50% of 
     4chan's traffic comes from Japan, and with the extreme lack of contribution for that 
     number, I consider providing almost half of the available bandwidth to people who do 
     not contribute a waste. This change should speed up the site and give me more 
     bandwidth to play with (read: more boards or features).</p></li>
     <li><p>Lastly I'd like to make one thing clear... Myself and the board mods are the law. 
     We will remain as open as possible to input and concerns, however if a descision is 
     made (such as removing a board or post), there should be no public whining and 
     complaining. This site is paid completely out of my pocket now (fuck you PayPal), and 
     it is a privilege, not a right. I do not charge for access to this site, thus there 
     should be no expectations that any user has direct say in any descisions made, and 
     that is how it will be from now on. As always I appreciate input, however I do not 
     appreciate the recent flames via e-mail and posts I have gotten regarding the 
     descision to remove two boards. If you believe you are entitled to tell me what to 
     do, you are sadly mistaken.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>That is all.</p>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: I forgot to mention the blocking of ri.cox.net and ph.cox.net.
    Way too many problematic users have come from these domains, thus I have chosen to
    ban them. Sorry to those who were negatively affected due to this block.</p>

    <p>Cancel that last update, a lot has transpired in less than twelve hours...</p>
    <p><strong>DJ Lucid</strong> was able to fix EVERY problem plaguing the site without a
    reformat. Kudos and mucho thanks to him.</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: PHP with full gd support.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: gif2png now works. GIFs are now being thumbed into 
     JPGs like the old board. I will fix GIF-&gt;PNG conversion in the next board 
     update.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: BMPs should upload fine now. I will be removing 
     them in the next board update.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: Thumbnailing and upload issues with gigantic 
     pictures (HxW and size wise). Make sure you leave your window open until the upload 
     completes! Remember, if it is a JPG image it must DECOMPRESS and then RECOMPRESS on 
     the server before it thumbs&mdash;this takes a bit for HUGE images (one 1.5MB JPG I was 
     using to test was 44MB uncompressed).</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>This miracle "board update" I'm talking about should take place next week, hopefully
    by Wednesday. It won't be apparent at first but this will spell out some great
    changes, here is a snippet from thatdog:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>"dynamic strings"</li>
     <li>Support for multiple data schema including MySQL.</li>
     <li>Render with valid semantic HTML and stylesheets.</li>
     <li>Fully dynamic page generation, removal of static pages.</li>
     <li>Per-user settings (language/posts per page/etc) without anonymity sacrifice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>ALL of these features won't be up by Wednesday, however I should at least have a
    working beta-board to fiddle with. I'm hoping that by mid-December all of the
    problems with the site will be hammered out, and there will be a no downtime no board
    wipe streak.</p>

    <p>The site will be on and off for a little bit while
    everything is updated. The stuff in the RH9 apt-get repository (ayo.freshrpms.net)
    wasn't so fresh, so the site was running MySQL3, old Apache/PHP, mods, etc.</p>
    <p>I know the Japanese text is messed up, and there are thumbnailing problems. There is
    a line in httpd.conf that needs changing to fix the text problems, however it isn't
    worth editing while everything is being updated. The problem with thumbnailing is
    that php-gd isn't installed yet (or libgd/gd2?), so images are just resized and
    thumbnails are not created. .gif's aren't being converted to PNG as well due to a
    problem with gif2png and maybe libgd. All of these problems will hopefully be fixed
    within the next day.</p>
    <p>One last thing: STOP UPLOADING BITMAPS (.bmp). For some reason the script isn't

    <p><em>Here comes a long awaited update:</em></p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>Where have you been?</em></p>
     <p>Busy, or doing :ninja: work on the site. This takes a lot more time than I originally 
     bargained for!</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Why haven't you responded to my e-mails?</em></p>
     <p>Webmail is down right now and I'm working with <strong>niralisse</strong> to get this 
     stuff back up and running. Don't send me mail for a day or so.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>The site was down for a few days&mdash;why!?</em></p>
     <p>4chan has yet another new home. It's actually the same server as before, just 
     formatted to RH9 and with no other sites on it.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Will the site be faster now?</em></p>
     <p>I expect it to be much faster. There will be one other SMALL personal site running on 
     this server, otherwise all remaining resources are at this site's disposal. Plesk is 
     gone (thank God), meaning I have to do everything by hand now, however it will be 
     MUCH easier to tweak and update packages. PHP/MySQL are now up to their current 
     versions instead of older ones like before, sqlite can be tested out, several 
     Apache/PHP optimizations, etc.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Does having the server to yourself cost more?</em></p>
     <p>Yes it does, however the price difference is bearable. I still appreciate any and all 
     donations, as it makes the "coming only out of your wallet" factor a bit less to 
     bear. I'd just like to note my PayPal is currently messed up and it will be a few 
     days until I can actually claim payments. I lost over $100 because I could not claim 
     payments due to their stupid policies ;_;</p></li>
     <li><p><em>What happened to the beta-archive and /r/ - TRAINZ?</em></p>
     <p>The beta-archive is being revamped and will be up shortly. Hopefully I won't have to 
     curtail pages by that much with the new server and all, but only time will tell. /r/ 
     was put up by <strong>thatdog</strong>, the guy who helps me with my PHP and 
     wrote the archive script, when he was testing the beta-archive. At the time I 
     couldn't host another board so I did not advertise it on any board but /b/. thatdog 
     has since purchased <a href="http://www.1chan.net">1chan</a> and is using 
     yotsuba-script to run a TRAINZ paradise.</p>
     <p>Check it out! I'll get around to linking it in a bit (this helps distribute load so I 
     don't have to add /r/ anymore).</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'd now just like to thank a few people that have been helping me keep the site
    running. In no particular order:</p>
    <p><strong>[NPH]</strong> - wrote this main page and helped me out with old optimization
    problems.<br />
    <strong>ichibanMuffin</strong> - partnered with me to revive 4chan (the second
    version). It didn't work out so we mutually called it off and now he has his own box
    again at the same datacenter.<br />
    <strong>hannibal (handyball)</strong> - bears with my whining and persistant
    questions about Linux, also was admin of the second server.<br />
    <strong>hova</strong> - helped me get my first translation of futaba-script working,
    I would probably have given up without the guy.<br />
    <strong>thatdog</strong> - made yotsuba-script better than ever, helped me with
    futabaSQL and made the beta-archive.<br />
    <strong>Scuzzy</strong> - wrote an anti-leech script and monitor just for 4chan. He
    also taught me how to trace in Photoshop.<br />
    <strong>Mangoat</strong> - got the third server formatted and running in pronto
    time. He's a behind the scenes kind of guy.<br />
    <strong>niralisse</strong> - walked me step-by-step through getting the new server
    back online, continues to do so.<br />
    <strong>$mods (haha variables!)</strong> - they quite frankly clean the shit out of
    every board, since I don't have the time to police them all like on day one.</p>
    <p>If I forgot anyone please forgive me as I don't have the best memory. The huge group
    that needs the most thanking is the people that contribute, since this community
    based website would not exist without a userbase!</p>
    <p>More updates will follow...</p>

    <p>Just wanted to say two things. If you donated,
    you'll notice your payment is probably unclaimed. I'm having some problems with
    PayPal and the bank and I hope to get that sorted out soon; sorry about that.</p>
    <p>In the next week two new boards will be added along with [hype]<strong>THE
    ARCHIVE</strong>[/hype]. "/a/ - Anime" and "/l/ - Lolikon" will be added soon; /a/
    will be soley dedicated to anime pictures of all types (so /b/ can still remain plain
    old random), and /l/ dedicated to lolikon. Some people started complaining that /c/
    was becoming a pedofest, and it was impossible to find *CUTE* pictures, thus I had to

    <p>I just dropped all of the old SQL tables, and 
    reloaded boards.4chan.org. The old post limit was 3000 entries, it has now been reduced
    to 750 entries per board. MySQLd along with PHP were optomized, however disk
    accessing could not be. The problem with 4chan is that I can't figure out how to
    auto-prune after ten pages like on 2chan, since the script is pretty hard to follow.
    When the boards got to over thirty pages long, each new post, reply, or thread caused
    the script to automatically regenerate the old static .htm files, causing alot of
    load on the system. When you take into account there are multiple boards all running
    on the same server, and the ability for multiple people to post within seconds, you
    can see how this caused the system to crawl. At the moment there is no fix for this,
    and boards will be considerably smaller&mdash;however I did backup the site before I wiped
    it, and will think about getting that archive subscription idea worked out.</p>

    <p>For those wondering why the site is running like
    ASS, it's because the server is getting overloaded by mysqld and all of the
    concurrent connections. It cannot be fixed without a new server or banning Japan.
    Right now I'm trying to figure out which is best.</p>
    <p>As far as sponsors go, Peter gave 4chan the thumbs down, this sucks a ton because I
    factored his "pledge" in with my calculations, and now 4chan just runs way too short
    of projections. ichi warned me that you cannot rely on donations for anything, I
    sadly did, and as it stands there is hardly enough money to keep the site running,
    the rest will have to be out of pocket or I need to get subscriptions worked out&mdash;I
    believe an overwhelming two people have contacted me about that. 4chan is on a server
    with another community website, and a few hosted sites (SMALL, that generate little
    revenue), and at current it is bogging these sites down, which is unacceptable.
    Solution? Get a dedicated server, however It's unreasonable for me to pay over $400 a
    month to provide a free service which does not benefit me in any monetary way; that's
    looking at it from a realist perspective. 4chan is going to die a humorously slow
    death within the next month if I can't figure out a way to either get mysqld loads
    down, or a way to make money.</p>
    <p>If you know anything about mysqld or sponsors, E-MAIL ME. If you would like to know
    about any potential subscriptions, or would like to donate, E-MAIL ME. PayPal is
    <span class="s">paypal@4chan.org</span>.</p>
    <p>I'm just going to flat out say it as it is: this site recieves way too many hits for
    the ammount of contribution. People who are still leeching, I'm going to start
    fucking with your leeched images if it doesn't stop, your forum posts at RAGNAROK
    ONLINE are going to turn into a man ripping his anus open. You have been

    <p>For the past few hours /g/ was broken; if you
    tried to post user#tripcode your output would not be <strong>user</strong> 
    !$crypt(code), but "Anonymous". This was probably caused when I changed the file

    Everything should be fine now, but I'm not sure why it only affected /g/, and not the
    other boards.</p>

    their posts weren't showing up and they were getting a Japanese error message... This
    message was caused by a built in anti-spam script, that tiggers at five seconds and

    <p>Site went back up a few hours ago; everything
    looks good. The oekaki board isn't up, I'll try to get that back in a few days...
    Thanks to everyone who donated, ichibanMuffin, and Peter Payne (J-List is now
    hopefully going to sponsor the site) for making this comeback possible; without your
    generosity it probably would not have happened.</p>
    <p>Some things that were fixed/changed/added:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: Thumbnailing problems! This should help curtail 
     bandwidth and load times.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Fixed</em>: Japanese character display&mdash;all pages should now be 
     UTF-8. Although UTF-8 isn't totally friendly with Japanese ASCII art, it should be a 
     large improvement (it's either this, no Japanese text, or improperly formatted 
     English).</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Changed</em>: The board now uses a MySQL database (modified 
     futabaSQL -&gt; "yotsubaSQL") for storing information. The last board used a flatcode 
     text file, which was pretty inefficient.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Changed</em>: Minor changes went into the board formats (ie. posts 
     now show the day of the week when posted).</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Added</em>: Protection from some robots, however this will only 
     help a little. Will look into some anti image linking (direct) soon.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Alot of ideas have been raised as how to keep this site up through donations, so far
    the following have been considered:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>Sponsors</em>: I believe J-list will sponsor us, since Peter said once 
     the site went back up he would consider it right away (yes this does mean ads, 
     however they won't be obnoxious) If you know anyone else who might be interested, 
     please <span class="s">contact me</span>.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>E-mail</em>: A few users inquired about paying for e-mail accounts. 
     I've consider requiring a small per year subscription for this, but I have yet to 
     think about exactly what would be offered. If you'd actually be interested in paying 
     for this, <span class="s">drop me a line</span>.</p></li>
     <li><p><em>Subscription</em>: Spork came up with a great idea (I would do this 
     at least, if I didn't run the site that is), involving paying for archive access. He 
     suggested providing the ability to download backups of older posts, since sometimes 
     the boards can be filled up so fast you miss good content. This should directly 
     impact bandwidth and speeds in a positive way, because I would be lowering the 
     ammount of posts per board, and only letting these subscribers access the old stuff. 
     Just a note: I am completely against forcing people to pay for use, however income is 
     needed to support the site. Please <span class="s">e-mail me</span> if you'd 
     be interested or have any input on the matter.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>With a new server also comes the ability to add a few more boards! The following have
    been suggested: trains, real-life, ASCII, weapons, and discussion. If you bear a
    strong liking to one of these subjects and would like to mod it, or have another idea
    for a new board, please <span class="s">e-mail me</span>!</p>
    <p>That said, <strong>ENJOY!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Wow.</strong></p>
    <p>I must say I'm impressed. Word has gotten out on 2chan and we have alot of new
    Japanese posters to the community. Every board seems to have had it's traffic at
    least doubled, and /c/ has had traffic go up tenfold! Obviously with so many new
    posts an influx of bandwidth usage has occured, however this is not a problem so far.
    I've gotten many donations today, and this will definantly help (or even totally) pay
    the bills. My huge thanks goes out to those who donated, and all of the dedicated
    users we have recieved thus far.</p>
    <p>I expect 4chan's English users to accept the new guys, and I don't want to see any
    racist crap on any boards (unless it's on /b/). I also expect 4chan's new Japanese
    users to use discretion on choosing which boards to post on. Granted there are no
    Japanese rules up, the most basic thing I ask is don't post "DESTROY USA BASES AT
    OKINAWA!!1" (LOL Golgolmois) on the real boards. Hopefully Shingo can work on getting
    the <a href="/rules">rules</a> page translated... In the mean
    time, check the following page out, <a href="japanese">日本語</a> (Japanese).</p>
    <p>Some things on the to do list:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>Fix thumbnailing problem for pictures. Thought we had this fixed, however 
     numerous new cases have been reported.</em></p></li>
     <li><p><em>Fix Japanese character display, and ASCII art. It appears that if you post off 
     of an English computer, it prints fine under UTF-8, however some posts from Japanese 
     computers seem to display incorrectly. I'll think about looking into Shift_JIS 
     again.</em></p></li>
     <li><p><em>Translate the 'Rules' section into Japanese. If you're Japanese and speak 
     English, help would be appreciated in the editing process. I can be e-mailed <span class="s">here</span>.</em></p></li>

    <p>Just throwing out an update for the people that
    actually read the main page. We hit ~9000 unique sessions in six days, with over one
    million hits! I'm very impressed, I never thought 4chan would get this popular so
    fast. You have have to remember, it's not like I'm going out of my way advertising
    left and right, in fact I've only posted the site on two or so boards...</p>
    <p>One thing I'd like to bring up is image leeching. I have no problem with you showing
    your friends pictures, or linking to them on forums. I do however have a problem with
    actually leeching the images on websites or other boards, simply because there isn't
    enough bandwidth for that. Scripts such as 2chtrawl are technically allowed (as I
    have no robots.txt or .htaccess restrictions), however I'd prefer people not use
    them.</p>
    <p>Two new image boards were added, and the <a href=
    "/rules">rules</a> updated:<br />
    <span class="s">/g/ - Guro</span><br />
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/s/">/s/ - Sexy Beautiful Women</a></p>
    <p>These two boards are the second and third user managed boards, and mark the end of my
    "board spree". I believe 4chan now has enough covered in terms of image boards, and
    maybe it's time to think about adding an ASCII board or just living with what is
    already available. Since these boards are new, they still have the possibility of
    being deleted if they don't recieve enough traffic. Also remember because they are
    user managed, all e-mails concerning them should be forwarded to the appropriate
    manager, NOT me.</p>
    <p>4chan is now looking for sponsers to help with the bills. Ads in the future are
    possible but not yet likely. By ad I mean something around 125x50 pixels, and plain.
    I have NO intentions of ever adding pop-ups, flashing ads, Flash layovers, etc. These
    ads make me want to gouge my eyes out, and I despise them as much as anyone else. I
    finally understand why sites need support; things aren't as cheap as they appear! As
    always my PayPal is still <strong>paypal@4chan.org</strong>, and my huge thanks goes
    out to the few people that have donated already. Don't get me wrong, donations will
    always be completely optional, and money should only be donated if you personally
    feel this site is worth it. Please also note, donating gives you no special
    treatment, and all of the normal rules will still apply to you.</p>

    <h3><span class="newssub">MORE UPDATES by moot -
    10/06/03 @ 7:50PM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#10" id="10"
    title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>Two new boards, and a host of changes!</p>
    <p>One new image board added:<br />
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/y/">/y/ - Yaoi</a></p>
    <p>...and a drawing board!<br />
    <span class="s">4chan Oekaki BBS</span></p>
    <p>Obviously the <a href="/rules">rules</a> have been updated to
    include these boards. Rules for the /c/ and /d/ boards were modified as well, be sure
    to check those out.</p>
    <p>Now on to a few things that need addressing. Alot of people are asking me to add new
    boards, one for /c/ without any nudity, dedicated dix board, deciated grotesque
    board, and of course the trainz/farm machinery boards. I'm perfectly okay with adding
    new boards, as long as we don't get repetitive. /c/ will stay the same, sifting
    through stuff won't kill you. /d/'s rules have been changed to better suit the
    anti-grotesque people out there. The problem with making so many image boards is
    twofold...</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p><em>I don't have the cash to support so many boards. Each new board is bandwidth, 
     and bandwidth costs MONEY! In six days, we are already 200% over the cap, at 50GB. 
     Donations are very welcome, I use <span class= 
     "s"><strong>paypal@4chan.org</strong></span> for PayPal.</em></p></li>
     <li><p><em>Adding more boards spreads out user participation too much. 4chan albeit new, 
     and very popular for a new site, is too small of a community to support so many 
     boards. By adding the yaoi and drawing boards I'm going out on a limb, as I 
     personally don't know how popular they will become. Prove me wrong guys.</em></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>That said, please keep the complaining for new boards and rules down. Unless it's a
    good idea that will attract participation, it isn't worth it right now. On a side
    note I'm interested in hosting boards for other communities at the moment, I talked
    with <span class="s">Bad Luck</span>, and she convinced me a yaoi board was a good
    idea, and she could get enough users to build it... thus /y/ was born.</p>
    <p>Still looking at ideas for what to add, as long as these ideas aren't like the
    examples above. If anyone knows a few artist friends or people that could help start
    up the oekaki board that would be great. I'm currently looking for someone to run
    that division of 4chan, as recently I've been pressed for spare time. You can read
    more about that position on the <a href="/rules">rules</a>
    page.</p>
    <span class="center">
      <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chan-BadLuck.png" alt="4chan-BadLuck.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" /><br />
      Bad Luck drew this for 4chan using the same board we use for the oekaki system.
      Very cute ;)

    <p>[NPH] and I believe we have figured out the retention
    bug. The bug caused posts to be deleted too quickly, on newly replied posts.</p>
    <p>The problem was the parameter for the maximum amount of log entries was too low, 500
    to be exact. Effective immediately the new max for /b/ is 2000, and for all other
    boards, 5000. That's REALLY high! We just want to see it's effect on the boards. Keep
    on posting so we can make sure this is the proper fix.</p>

    <p>Rather large update...</p>
    <p>Two new image boards added:<br />
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/c/">/c/ - Anime/Cute</a><br />
    <a href="//boards.4chan.org/d/">/d/ - Hentai/Alternative</a></p>
    <p>Updated the <a href="/rules">rules</a>, please check them
    out!</p>
    <p>A Japanese explanation of 4chan has been added! Check it out <a href=
    "/japanese">here</a>, many thanks to Shingo for doing this.
    If you see any problems with the translation or think something needs adding, you can
    <span class="s">e-mail Shingo</span>.</p>
    <p>Glad to see the participation and support so far, keep it up. Again, if you know of
    any good people or places to advertise 4chan, go ahead. Just bear in mind retarded
    posters are not wanted. Lasty I'd just like to thank nem from <a href=
    "http://www.apisnetworks.com/">Apis</a> again, without his generosity 4chan would not
    be possible. If you decide to host with him, please put "4chan" as your referrer,
    this gives me more bandwidth to play around with, meaning more boards and features.</p>

    10/02/03 @ 6:37PM EST</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#6" id="6" title=
    "permalink">#</a></span></h3>
    <p>In order to resolve the rampant misconceptions and
    flames I'm getting on <span class="s">world2ch</span> (without my knowledge), I'll
    post some quick points:</p>
	<ol>
	 <li><p><em>4chan is a Something Awful/ADTRW run conspiracy.</em></p>
	 <p>Please stop mixing 4chan up with "SA's hentai forum is trying to steal our 
	 thunder!!", it's a stupid argument that is untrue. The reason that the ADTRW users 
	 outnumber the non-ADTRW users is because I posted it there first, and rather than 
	 embrace this site, others are holing themselves up into what I will call "the elitist 
	 brooding state of mind" (tm).</p></li>
	 <li><p><em>4chan is supposed to be ADTRW only, and consist primarily of pictures of 
	 animated children (pedo anime), with some added women and children with penises 
	 (dickgirlz).</em></p>
	 <p>Sorry, but no. 4chan is open to everyone, and I WANT people outside of ADTRW to use 
	 it. The quote "a comprehensive english based resource for the collection and 
	 distribution of yaoi and dickgirlz" (previous title), is simply one of comical value, 
	 a kind of inside joke. Why did I choose this seemingly horrid sentence as a quote? I 
	 had no clue it would offend anybody... sorry guys, but sarcasm is prevalent on the 
	 internet as well as real life!</p></li>
	 <li><p><em>But the /b/ image board is full of it!</em></p>
	 <p>If you bother to read the <a href="/rules">rules</a>, you'll 
	 see /b/ is meant to be nothing short of a retard bin for now. It will be changed 
	 within the week. The site has existed for only two days now guys, sorry if I can't 
	 put up forty boards at once.</p></li>
	 <li><p><em>You stole world2chan's code and didnt even plug us! How RUDE.</em></p>
	 <p>I never even knew futaba was public until I edited the ENTIRE code of GazouBBS (the 
	 base of futaba). I was then cheerfully informed that, all of my efforts had just been 
	 wasted, as 2chan freely shares their PHP coding. Before this, I had never frequented 
	 world2ch much, and also had no clue their Eng<em>r</em>ish translation of 
	 futaba (0ch is it?) was released as well. 4chan's script has been further modified 
	 (more than you can actually see), and will continue to be modified as scripters offer 
	 their help.</p>
	 <p>Time 4chan has had code to work with: 72 hours.<br />
	 Time 2chan/world2ch has had code to work with: Years?</p></li>
	 <li><p><em>4chan sucks, moot sucks, ADTRW sucks, SA sucks, Apis sucks...</em></p>
	 <p>Awsome. I whole heartedly thank those who have e-mailed me voicing their opinions and 
	 concerns (to date: 0) regarding 4chan. Furthermore, posting threads 
	 on another board is the best way to attract my attention, keep at it. (If you haven't 
	 noticed, this is the "sarcasm" I was talking about earlier)</p></li>
	 <li><p><em>You're immature, and this response has done nothing to sway my opinion.</em></p>
	 <p>If this is the way some of you are thinking right now, I am truly sorry for you. The 
	 above is meant to be my serious response (as anything posted on the main page will 
	 be), to the discontent peoples of world2ch and abroad. For the tenth time I will 
	 reiterate: E-MAIL ME. If you're either too immature or incompetant to have a real 
	 two-way conversation with me, without hiding behind the magic of the internet, you 
	 very well could be an idiot. If the previous is true, please do not waste my time, or 
	 your time... by e-mailing me I am requesting a decent piece of writing sent to me 
	 outlaying your concerns, suggestions, or questions. Please refrain from sending me 
	 "WORLD2CH ALLIANCE WILL CRUSH YOU", as I have just stated you are an idiot.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>I hope that clears some things up. You can read my previous response on world2ch's
    ongoing thread (as well as my host's) <span class="s">here</span>.</p>

    <p>Greeting 4chan users!</p>
    <p>As you can see, 4chan now has a nice mainpage up. With this, I can now post the
    updates and plans I had previously been withholding... Let me start off by posting a
    little about 4chan:</p>
    <p>4chan is meant to be an unofficial sister site to <a href=
    "http://www.2chan.net">2chan.net</a>, an amazing Japanese community that has been
    around for a long time. This website, while similar to it's Japanese counterpart, is
    NOT trying to replace 2chan... that's simply impossible. 4chan is merely bringing to
    the table, what English speaking people have lacked for a while; a diverse community
    united around the simple thousand line piece of PHP code that we call tagboard. Our
    site is meant to be an equal alternative for non-Japanese speaking persons to
    interact as they would on 2chan, with an active and diverse community. The road to
    becoming a full fledged sister-site will be a long and difficult one, however I
    believe that with the help of a few dedicated individuals, and a large, helpful,
    friendly community, greatness can be achieved.</p>
    <p>Everyone is equally welcomed at this website, as long as you keep your drama and
    warring elsewhere. By trying to start flamewars between 2chan, <span class=
    "s">world2ch</span>, and 4chan, you're just hurting the web-based English anime
    community. Please don't do it, you have nothing to gain, and others end up losing
    out. That said, if you enjoy this site, tell your friends! Both English and Japanese
    users are again, *equally*, welcomed here if they meet the above requirement.</p>
    <p>Please bear with us as we get the site online. ALL feedback is valued, and I'll try
    my best to get around to looking at it. The only way this site will improve and
    hopefully flourish, is with constant user input on how it should be run. I've already
    asked several people to help out, and am still looking for a few more dedicated
    individuals to help out with 4chan. If you think you have what it takes (PHP coders
    wanted), shoot me an email!</p>
    <p>That said, enjoy the boards!</p>
    <p><strong>Edit for the world2ch crew:</strong> Don't worry, there is no plan to put up
    several inactive sports and political forums. This will be largely image and comedy
    based, we have no intention of partaking in intelligent discussions concerning
    foreign affairs. By sister-site, I mean focusing primarily on certain likable aspects
    of 2chan, not just a mirror. Your territory is safe.</p>
    <p>I only say this after I politely asked people not to post stupid stuff on these
    boards, and to take any problems or concerns directly to me in the form of e-mail.</p>
